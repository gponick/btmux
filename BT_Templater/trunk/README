Thus begin my tinkerings to create a group of classes that accurately depicts one of
the various unit types in Battletech. I may eventually write a GUI that uses the
class if someone else doesn't.

NOTE: This is mostly just a tinker project for me to play around and learn the
nuances of Java, as my work as a student requires me to know it. This is a good
way to learn and pursue an interest of mine at the same time. As is such, don't
expect this code to be top notch, it's an experiment in which I'm trying to use
a variety of techniques for better understanding.

Exile Source Release
--------------------
The Exile source has been re-released under 3030's artistic license with the
permission of the previous authors. We are making this available to everyone
in hopes of getting additional help with porting features from here to the
new BtOnline codebase, and for historical value. Please note that this
branch is NO LONGER MAINTAINED, you will need an experienced hardcoder to
assist in fixing bugs and some outstanding issues if you plan on running a
site with this. Note that we can not offer anything more than a "good luck"
since our focus is now on the new codebase.

About this Codebase
-------------------
The Exile source is explained on our 'About our codebase' wiki page. If
you'd like to know where this tree fit into the development of BTMux,
take a peek at: http://docs.btmux.com/index.php/About_our_Codebase

Sites that Ran this Codebase
----------------------------
* Exile : Exodus 
  The site this branch was created for and primarily developed on. It 
  featured the mammoth-sized crawlers we all came to know and love.

* Battletech: The Frontier Lands
  A hybrid RS/SimSite that ran Exile code for over two years. 

Getting Help
------------
You may find resources on http://docs.btmux.com for general softcode help,
but again, this code is currently not being promoted or widely used (if at
all) due to the work being done on the new codebase. You will find that
help is at a premium due to differences in the way things operate.

The License File
----------------
Take a look at the LICENSE file for legalities. The gist of it is that if
you modify this codebase, you MUST make your modifications public or
submit patches back to the BtOnline-Btech project. Since we are no longer
maintaining this branch, you will just need to make your changes public.

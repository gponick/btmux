1115665206 [Tips] The 'navigate' command is every bit as useful as 'tactical'. With 'navigate' it will show you your exact location within the current hex. It can help you make your way around terrain edges or drastic elevation changes. People who exclaim "I just clipped a hex" probably weren't watching navigate close enough.
1115665806 [Tips] You may purchase inexpensive rentals units from Rent-A-Mech in the Commercial District in the Spaceport.
1115666406 [Tips] If your unit is still in or on a base hex you can tweak your targeting computer. Type 'tweaktarg' in your unit for full details. Essentially you can modify your bth based on your range to the target.

 >> Help: Outfits
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Outfits are small groups of players that are hired by the players themselves.
 The members within the outfit will refaction together, so they remain
 constant across redistributions.
 
 To see a list of outfits currently in the game, use the 'outfits' command.
 
 TIP: Make sure to tell future outfit mates that have yet to create a
      character not to 'rollfaction' in character generation. They need to use
	  'outfit/apply <youroutfit#>' and you must accept them.
 
 For a detailed look at outfits, see our online documentation:

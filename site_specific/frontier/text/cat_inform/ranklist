 Syntax: ranklist
 
 The 'ranklist' command lists in order the various ranks you can achieve on
 the Frontier. You can see which rank you are by finding the yellow Rank
 Number. This command will also let you know how much XP you need to gain the
 next rank (this information is viewable if you type 'stats' as well).

 >> Help: Outfits (Informational Command)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Outfits are small groups of players that are hired out by the different 
 factions. The members are constant across redistributions and you are 
 guaranteed to end up in the same faction that your Outfit mates are in.
 
 To see a list of outfits currently in the game, use the 'outfits' command.
 
 TIP: Make sure to tell future outfit mates that have yet to create a
 character not to 'rollfaction' in character generation. They need to
 use 'outfit/apply <youroutfit#>' and you must accept them.

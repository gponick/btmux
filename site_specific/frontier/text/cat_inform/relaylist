 Syntax: relaylist ('.rel' if you have the default macro set)
 Syntax: relaylist/map ('.relm' if you have the default macro set)
 
 The 'relaylist' command in its various forms gives you different versions of
 information you need to know about the relays on the Frontier:
 
 - The first form shows you what each relay's location, owner, range from you,
   and condition is.
 - The second form shows you a rough sketch of the map outline and the
   location of each relay on the map. The abbreviations for each relay will be
   in the faction owner's color.

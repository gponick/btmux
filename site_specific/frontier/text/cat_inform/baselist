 >> Help: Baselist (Informational Command)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Syntax: Baselist
 Syntax: Baselist/map
 
 The 'Baselist' command lists all of the bases on the map along with other
 basic information about each. Note that only bases you own or are nearby will
 display the amount of energy they have.
 
 The second form of this command shows the map and the bases arranged on it
 along with who owns it. Bases being claimed will appear lower case and
 flashing. The text-based map was contributed by Martlet.

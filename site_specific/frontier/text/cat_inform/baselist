 Syntax: baselist ('.bl' if you have the default macro set)
 Syntax: baselist/map ('.blm' if you have the default macro set)
 
 The 'baselist' command in its various forms gives you different versions of
 information you need to know about the generators on the Frontier:
 
 - The first form shows you what each generator's energy payout, location,
   range from you, owner, and condition is.
 - The second form shows you a rough sketch of the map outline and the
   location of each generator on the map. All bases have the owner's color
   associated with each base. If a base is in the process of being claimed,
   the abbreviation will flash in the claiming faction's color.

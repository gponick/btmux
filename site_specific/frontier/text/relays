 >> Help: Relays
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Relays are small towers that serve a dual purpose. They relay all radio
 communications they pick up on your faction's channel around the map,
 therefore extending the radio range of your faction's chatter. This is
 very helpful on large maps, where individual units aren't likely to be able
 to broadcast to even a portion of the map.
 
 Relays are also armed with some limited defenses that help in keeping the
 immediate area around it guarded.

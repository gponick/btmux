 >> Help: Toughness (Advantage)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 3 dice are rolled, and the best 2 are calculated towards your Conscious Roll
 check.
 
 Result: You are less likely to be knocked unconscious in combat.
 
   Example: In order to remain concious, your BTH is 6, so you must roll a
   			6 or higher. With Toughness, you roll 3 dice: 2, 3, and 7.
			Final roll total is 3 + 7 = 10.
   However, if you did not have Toughness, your roll would be 2 + 3 = 5.

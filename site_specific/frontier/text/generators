 >> Help: Generators
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Function: Generators provide fuel (or energy) for your faction's bases. Every
 15-30 minutes, for each generator your faction owns, a certain amount of fuel
 is deposited in each of your bases.
 
 Claiming: (similar to relays) Simply destroy the generator. Generators are
 armed much more heavily than relays, since they have more potential to turn
 the tide in battle. If you part of a group of friendlies, and you do not fire
 the final shot, you must be within 15 hexes to receive any claim reward.
 
 Inactivity: After being destroyed, the generator is transferred to your
 faction's ownership and remains destroyed for a period of 15-30 minutes.
 After or during this period of time, if there are no enemies within 15 hexes,
 the generator will automatically repair itself and restart at full health.

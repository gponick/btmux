 >> Help: Generators
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Generators are similar to relays in appearance and identical as far as
 claiming them goes except for one thing: Generators are capable of providing
 fuel for your faction's bases. Every 15-30 minutes, for each generator your
 faction has, a certain amount of fuel is deposited in each of your bases.
 
 * You may see what each generator's payout, location, owner, and condition
   is via the 'genlist' command.
 
 For a detailed look at bases, see our online documentation:

& bases
 
 >> Help: Bases
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bases are the basic unit of territory in the game. Factions battle to capture
 and control bases in order to achieve victory. Bases are also used as
 points for units to deploy from, having more bases gives your faction more
 room for tactical maneuvering.

 * You may see the location, owner, and fuel levels of each base by typing
   'baselist'.

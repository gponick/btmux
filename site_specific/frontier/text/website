 >> Help: Website
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The website is closely integrated and informed of what's going on in-game.
 When new players are created, they must let the website know of their
 existance by use of the 'webreg' command. See 'help webreg' for more details
 on how to use this and what it does.
 
 The website currently features interesting and useful information such as
 player profiles, states, maps, unit lists, and much more.
 
 Point your browser to http://frontiermux.com to view our site. Note that user
 registration is done via the 'webreg' command rather than on the website
 itself.

& communication 
 
 >> Help: Communication
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 There are several different levels of communication on the Frontier:
 * say - The most basic way to communicate is by talking to those that are
   in the same room as you. You may see who is present by typing 'look'.
   To use say, type 'Say <message>', replacing <message> with what you want
   to say. Remember that only people in the same room can hear you.
 
 * fa - To talk to the people in your faction (type 'census' to see who is
   currently online in your faction), type 'fa <message>'.
 
 * pub - To talk over the general chatter channel for the game, type
   'pub <message>'. This is not a faction-specific channel, everyone who is
   on the channel can hear you.
 
 * faq - To ask questions, type 'faq <message>'.

 >> Help: Communication
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 There are several different levels of communication on the Frontier. Be sure
 to replace <message> with what you want to broadcast in the room/on channels.
 
 * say <message>
     The most basic way to communicate is by talking to those that are in the
     same room as you. You may see who is present by typing 'look'. Remember
     that only people in the same room can hear you.
 
 * fa <message>
     This channel is used to talk to the people in your faction (type 'census'
     to see who is currently online in your faction).
 
 * pub <message>
     The Public channel is where all the general conversations for this game
     take place. This is not a faction-specific channel, so everyone on the
     channel can hear you (including your faction's enemies).
 
 * faq <message>
     The FAQ channel is where you can ask game-related questions.
 
 * page <playername>=<message>
     Sometimes it is important to speak to a player individually and privately
     (ex: a staff member, see also 'staff'). By paging the player, the
     message will only be seen by you and the player you are paging.

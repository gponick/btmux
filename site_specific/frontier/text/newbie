 The Frontier is a bit more of a complex game than the typical MU*. To be a
 successful pilot, you must learn how to control the units in your arsenal
 with deadly efficiency.
 
 The best way to get started is to read over:
 http://docs.btmux.com/index.php/Site_Frontier:Getting_Started
 
 If you have already done parts of this, skip over or skim them and move
 on until you find things you don't know. After going through training, check
 out http://bmi.btmux.com for a guide on piloting mechs.
 
 There is a wealth of information on the Frontier section of the BTMux
 wiki:

 >> Help: Placing Bounties (Economy)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bounties are a means of making it more attractive to kill certain people. You
 can set bounties by looking at the Bounty Board in an old warehouse in the
 Commercial District of the Spaceport (from your Re-Spawner Room:
 go-sp, cd, wh).
 
  * The minimum bounty increment is 25 C-Bills, so you have to go up at least
    25 each time.
  * The maximum total bounty is 1,000 C-Bills.
  * Bounties may only be claimed if both the victim and the bounty hunter are
    in valid in-character units on the map--you cannot find them somewhere in
    the Spaceport and kill them to collect the reward.
  * Bounties may only be claimed on people outside of your own faction.
 
 To see who is currently wanted, you can use the 'bountylist' command from
 anywhere in the game. To see other bounty-related commands, type
 'help bounties'.
 
 You may review what bounties were claimed and by who on the daily news post
 on The Frontier Times bulletin board in-game ('help bulletin_board').

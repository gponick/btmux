 NOTE: You can be anywhere to access this list by typing 'unitpl'.
 
 The Purchase List is the list of permanent mechs that you can purchase, sell
 back for a percent of the price, or sell to other players. In order to do any
 of these functions, you will need to be in your faction's re-spawner room,
 and use the command 'unit' (or 'help unit_purchase' if you are not in the
 re-spawner).
 
 Some also: unit_purchasing, unit_purchase

 >> Help: AP (Advancement Points) (Currency)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Advancement points (APs) are used to buy skills and advantages. For each rank
 you gain, you get an advancement point. So a Private (Rank 1) would have 1 AP
 while a Captain (Rank 15) would have 15 APs ('help rank').
		    
 How do I earn APs?
 ------------------
 APs are directly related to XP in that you must earn XP in order to gain APs.
 By typing 'ranklist' you can see the various levels of XP required for the
 different ranks on The Frontier, and the amount of APs you have is equal to
 your rank. To see how you earn XP, type 'help XP'

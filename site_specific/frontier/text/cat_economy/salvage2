 Recovering a unit:
   * Your mech must have Hand Actuators (use 'viewref/specs <unitref>').
   * The recovery unit must be of equal or greater tonnage than the
     salvageable unit in order to tow it. Certain units can be of less tonnage
     and still tow salvageable units ('help special_technology').
   * Travel to the same hex as the salvageable unit and type: 'pickup <ID>'
     where the ID is the the two letter ID you see on your contacts list.
   * Tow the salvageable unit back to any base hex your faction owns.
   * Once on a base hex, type 'salvage' and you have successfully recovered
     the unit.

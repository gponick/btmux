 >> Help: Playing the Lottery (Economy)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You can purchase permanent mechs with C-Bills if luck is on your side at the
 Lottery Terminal, which is located at the Lottery House in the Entertainment
 District of the Spaceport (from your Re-Spawner Room: go-sp, ed, lh). Once
 you are in the Lottery House, type 'look terminal' to see which mechs are
 being raffled away in the lotteries, the cost of a ticket, how many tickets
 have been bought, and how much longer the lottery will last. To purchase
 tickets, you can use the command listed at the bottom of the terminal, or use
 the command shown here:
 
   * buyticket <Lottery#> <#Tickets>
       Example: buyticket 1 50
        This buys 50 tickets for lottery 1.
   
 Some notes about playing the lottery:
   * You can only buy a maximum number of tickets, designated on the terminal.
   * The command above must be done from within the Loterry House.
   
 How the Drawings are Done:
   On the ending date and time, a winner is randomly selected from the number
   of tickets bought. The winner is announced on The Frontier Times bulletin
   board in-game ('help bulletin_board'). If you are lucky, and the mech
   becomes yours, you can do whatever you wish with it, as if it were your own
   permanent mech (play with it, trade it, or sell it for XP).

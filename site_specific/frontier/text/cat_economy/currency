 >> Help: Currency System (Economy)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 In order to work within the economy of The Frontier, you will have to know
 its currency system.
 
 What are the components?
 ------------------------
  XP - 'Experience Points' are the primay unit of currency in our economy. You
       can use XP to buy new units, gain rank and advancement points, skills,
	   and advantages. XP can't be lost and it can't be converted to or from
	   C-Bills. There are two forms of XP:
	    * spendable XP - used to purchase units off your purchase list
		* total XP     - calculates your rank, gives you advancement points
		                 accordingly, and then you can buy skills/advantages
  C-Bills - C-Bills are the secondary currency in our economy. They serve the
       purpose of handling day to day expenses, such as orbital requests,
	   rental units, playing the lottery, setting bounties, and certain Squad
	   uses (not currently available).
  AP - 'Advancement points' are used to buy skills and advantages. For each
       rank you gain, you get an advancement point. So a Private (Rank 1)
	   would have 1 AP while a Captain (rank 15) would have 15. ('help rank')
  DP - 'Donation Points' are earned for either taking on projects that benefit
       the site or BattletechMUX as a whole, or donating money at a conversion
	   rate of $1 per DP.

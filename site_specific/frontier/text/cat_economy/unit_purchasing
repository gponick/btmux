 >> Help: Unit Purchasing (Economy)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 One of the main goals in Frontiers, if not the Main Goal, is to advance by
 buying bigger and better mechs. You do this by buying and selling permanent
 units.
 
 To purchase permanent mechs, you will need to earn XP ('help currency') and
 use the commands listed on 'help unit_purchase'. Additionally, if luck is on
 your side, you can gamble for permanent mechs by playing the lottery
 ('help playing_lottery') where you use C-Bills to purchase lottery tickets.
 
 NOTE: You must be in the re-spawner room to use 'unit' and its commands. To
       see information on these commands without being in the re-spawner, type
       'help unit_purchase'.
	   
 You can purchase other units besides the permanent ones--specifically,
 limited availability units. These can be purchased a number of different
 ways. Refer to 'help limited_units' for more details.

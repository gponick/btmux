 >> Help: Limited Availability Units (Economy)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Limited availability units (LAUs) are units that can only be destroyed a
 certain number of times before they are expended. These are different from
 the permanent units you can buy with XP ('help unit_purchasing'). While LAUs
 can be used an infinite number of times, each time the pilot dies in the
 unit, he/she loses a "charge" of that unit. You can see these charges
 following the name of the LAU in ()'s.
 
 There are several ways to come obtain LAUs:
  * Using the rental interface ('help renting_units') to rent LAUs with
    C-Bills ('help currency').
  * Obtaining LAUs by discovering data caches ('help data_caches').
  * Salvaging LAUs off the map ('help salvage').
  * Participating in an underground event ('help underground').

 How do I earn the different currencies?
 ---------------------------------------
  XP - Engage in combat against enemy mechs, piloting the map
       and making successful piloting skill checks ('help skills'), picking up
	   data caches ('help data_caches'), and claiming objectives either by
	   holding the claim, or simply destroying it ('help objectives').
  C-Bills - Picking up data caches ('help data_caches'), fueling bases
       ('help fueling'), and claiming objectives either by holding the claim,
	   or simply destroying it ('help objectives').
  AP - APs are directly related to XP in that you must earn XP in order to
       gain APs.  By typing 'ranklist' you can see the various levels of XP
	   required for the different ranks on The Frontier, and the amount of APs
	   you have is equal to your rank.
  DP - See 'help staff' for other information on how you can get involved
       either by donating, or contributing time into projects that benefit the
	   site or BattletechMUX as a whole.

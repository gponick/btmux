 Warp Gates are strange structures of unknown origin scattered about the map
 that have the ability to instantly teleport anything that passes through
 them to a corresponding gate on the other end. One must simply pass through
 a warp hex to end up on the other side.
 
 * Type 'warplist' to see a list of warp pairs. You may enter from either
   side and end up on the opposite.

 Warp Gates are strange structures of unknown origin scattered about the map
 that have the ability to instantly teleport anything that passes through them
 to a corresponding gate on the other end. One must simply pass through a warp
 hex to end up on the other side.
 
 Recovery Period: After each warp, there is a period of 2 minutes where you
 may not warp again. A timer is shown on your unit's internal description
 showing how long you have until you can warp again. Type 'look' to see this.
 
 Troubleshooting: To trigger the teleport function of a warp gate, you must
 walk onto the hex. However, certain circumstances (ex: overwhelming number
 of enemy mechs on the other side of the warp) require that you can't move on
 and off the hex. Once the 2 minute timer has run down, you can manually
 activate the teleport function by typing 'trigger'.

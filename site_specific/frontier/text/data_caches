 >> Help: Data Caches
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Data caches are randomly dispersed throughout the map, waiting for vigilant
 individuals to discover them and unlock their secrets. These caches contain
 things such as XP, C-Bills, or rental units.
 
 Data caches are found by running around and checking your contacts list via
 the contacts command, ( .c if you have the default macro set set). Although
 they appear as hostile on your contact list, they will not fire at you and
 can't be destroyed.
 
 To retrieve the data cache, simply be speed 0 in the same hex as the cache,
 and type 'pickup <ID>'.
 
 NOTE: You have to have a unit that has Hand Actuators or Salvge Tech under
       the Special Technology section after typing 'viewref/specs <mech_ref>'
	   in order to retrieve data caches.

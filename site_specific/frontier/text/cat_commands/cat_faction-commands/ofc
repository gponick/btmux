 The 'ofc' command in its various forms is the front-end to the commander (or
 officer) order system.
 
 NOTE: These commands require commander or officer status.
 
 - The first form displays all the various sub-commands of 'ofc'.
 - The second form sets a factional CF ('concentrated fire', or primary
   target) to a specific ID. This command has nothing to do with auto-locking
   the enemy.
 - The third form sets a faction's hot-base. Now factionmates can type
   'respawn/hotbase' as opposed to finding the base's number.
 - The fourth form relays a message describing the faction's current
   objectives.
 - The fifth form makes a rally hex at hex x, y for all faction mates to group
   together.
 To view all the information your commander/officer has set, type 'orders'.

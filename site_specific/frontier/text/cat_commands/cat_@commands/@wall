& @wall
 
 Syntax: @wall[/switches] <message>
 
 With no switches, shouts <message> to every connected player or to every
 connected wizard, prefixed by either 'Announcement:' (if for everyone) or
 'Broadcast:' (if for wizards). The following switches can be used to get the
 described effects:
   /emit      - Format the message as an emit (ie send just <message>).
   /pose      - Format the message as a pose (ie <yourname> <message>).
   /wizard    - Only send the message to connected wizards.
   /admin     - Send the message to connected wizards and royalty.
   /no_prefix - Don't prepend 'Announcement:' or 'Broadcast:' to the message.
                If neither /emit or /pose are used, you can format the message
				one of several ways by specifying ':', ';', or '"' as the
				first character of the message. ':' and ';' format the message
				as if /pose were specified, except that ';' does not insert a
				space between your name and the message. '"' formats the
				message in normal @wall format (this is the default).
 
 NOTE: The message is also written to the main netmux log file.

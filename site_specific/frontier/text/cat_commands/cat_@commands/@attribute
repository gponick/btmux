& @attribute
 
 Syntax: @attribute[/<switc>] <attrib>[=<value>]
 
 Performs operations on user-named attributes depending on the switch used.
 The following switches are available: 
   /access - Changes the access to the named attribute. <value> is a space-
             separated list of permissions to add or remove from the
			 attribute's access permissions.
   /delete - Removes the named attribute from the attribute table. This switch
             does not remove instances of the attribute from objects, and any
			 that remain will be renamed to the user-named attribute that
			 re-uses the attribute number of the deleted attribute.
   /rename - Changes the name of the named attribute to <value>.
 
 NOTE: Changes to user-named attributes performed by this command are
       permanent and do not need to be performed each time the MUX is
	   restarted.

& @query
 
 Syntax: @query/sql
           <dbslot>/<obj>/<attr>/<preserve>[/<columnDelim>][/<resultDelim>]
		   =<query>
 
 SQL queries are done via the @query command. Queries are sent to the sqlslave
 process and come back into the MUX, triggering the object/attribute
 combination you specify, passing the results as %0 registers.
 
 Argument Breakdown:
  <dbslot>         - Can be letters A-E as defined in the netmux.conf file.
  <obj> and <attr> - The object/attribute combination that are to be triggered
                     when the results arrive.
  <preserve>       - Any data you'd like to 'come back' with the query. It's
                     like using setr() from within the command.
  [<columnDelim>]  - (Optional) The delimiter that seperates columns within
                     result sets. Defaults to ':' if nothing is supplied.
  [<resultDelim>]  - (Optional) The delimiter that is used to seperate
                     results. Defaults to '|' if nothing is supplied.

& @delcommand
 
 Syntax: @delcommand <name>[=<thing>/<attribute>]
 
 Deletes a command added by @addcommand. With only <name> specified, deletes
 all added commands under <name>. When you specify <thing> and <attribute>, it
 only deletes that specific entry. If the command or commands you are deleting
 had replaced a built-in command, the built-in command and all aliases are
 restored to their normal names and actions.

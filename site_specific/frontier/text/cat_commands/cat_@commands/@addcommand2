& @addcommand2
 
 You can specify more than one attribute to go with <name>. When you type
 'look' or 'look sofa', the game will execute all attributes that match what
 you have typed in. Aliases like 'l' are expanded to 'look' so you don't have
 to worry about those when you take command matching into consideration. If
 none of the attributes attached match (the attribute must begin with $<name>
 in order to match at all!), no output will be generated.
 
 Another use is to speed up use of a particular global command. Just use
 @addcommand to add it to the built-in list, and it will be looked up much
 faster.

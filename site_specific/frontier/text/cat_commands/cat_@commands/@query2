 Handling Results:
  <attr> must contain a trigger of some sort to handle the results from the
   query. <attr> is triggered just as if I did a:
     @tri <obj>/<attr>=<preserve>
   Meaning that preserved strings come back as a register. There are currently
   four registers used for SQL results:
     %0 - A numerical value expressing the success or failure of the query.
	      Values are:
           -1 = A serious MUX failure occurred, and the request should not be
		        retried.
            0 = The SQL engine reported an error. Depending on the error, the
			    request may be retried.
            1 = The command completed successfully.
     %1 - The actual query results. Fields will be seperated with ':' or
	      supplied columnDelim value. Row will be seperated with '|' or
		  supplied resultDelim value.
     %2 - The preserved info that was stuck in the <preserve> argument with
	      @query.
     %3 - Status of the query (usually a 'Success' or an Error message of some
	      sort depending on syntax).
   So in effect, the @query results come back like this if I was manually
   @trigger'ing the attribute:
     @tri <obj>/<attr>=<statusCode>,<results>,<preserve>,<statusMsg>

& @boot
 
 Syntax: @boot[/<switches>] <player>
 
 Severs the named player's connection to the game. The player is given a
 notice that they have been booted. If the player is connected to the game
 more than once, then all connections to that player are severed.
 
 The following switches are available: 
   /quiet - Don't give the booted player any special notice.
   /port  - Disconnects only a specific port (port numbers may be obtained
            from the 'session' command). In this case <player> must be a
			number.

& @restart
 
 Syntax: @restart
 
 This command literally restarts the game. To the players, it appears as
 merely a short pause in the action. There are many reasons to @restart,
 including updating the source code, freeing built-up memory, etc. @restart
 dumps and reloads the database, so you cannot use it to change the database.
 You may recompile and use @restart to implement the changes without having to
 @shutdown.
 
 @restart maintains all connections, any relevant information about them
 across restarts. Nothing should be adversely affected by an @restart.
 However, it should be used sparingly due to the tedious nature of dumping and
 loading the database.
 
 NOTE: If you update the MUX binary with an outside binary, you should never
 overwrite the old one. Instead, you should delete or move it, and place the
 new binary in its place, for reasons beyond the scope of this document. This
 warning does not apply if you remake the binary in your game's source
 directory.

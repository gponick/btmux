& @addcommand
 
 Syntax: @addcommand <name>=<thing>/<attribute>
 
 This command has the capability of adding a softcoded command to the MUX's
 built-in command table. If <name> already exists as a built-in command,
 such as 'look' or 'who', it will actually replace the functionality of that
 command, and all aliases that currently point to it. As in look's case, the
 aliases 'l', 'lo', and 'loo', and the main command 'look' will all point to
 these softcoded commands. The syntax of <thing>/<attribute> is like any
 normal $command.
 
 Example:
 
 > &LOOK me=$look:say I looked here!
 > &LOOK_WITH_ARG me=$look *:say I looked at %0!
 > &LOOK_OUTSIDE me=$look/outside *:say I looked outside at %0!
 > @addcommand look=me/look
 > @addcommand look=me/look_with_arg
 > @addcommand look=me/look_outside
 
{ 'help @addcommand2' for more }

 >> Help: Rental Interface (Economy Commands)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Limited Availability Units can be obtained at the Rent-A-Mech room in the
 Commercial District of the Spaceport. Once you are in Rent-A-Mech, you type
 'look interface' to see all the units available to purchase with C-bills. The
 commands you need to know to use the interface are listed at the bottom of
 the unit listing, or here:
 
 Syntax: rent <unit>
 Syntax: return <unit>
 
 - The first command allows you to rent any unit on the interface unit listing
   and the unit reference is case sensitive.
 - The second command allows you to return all charges of a limited
   availability unit that you own.
 
 NOTE: These commands must be done from within Rent-A-Mech in the Spaceport.

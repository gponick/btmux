 >> Help: Skill Purchase (Economy Commands)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Syntax: train <skill>
 Syntax: forget <skill>
 
 Once you have located Ye Olde Augmentation Shoppe in the Spaceport, you use
 the commands 'stats' and 'look training' to view which skills you already
 have and a list of all the skills you can buy with their AP purchase cost
 (see 'help AP').
 
 When you 'look training' you'll notice a matrix of numbers that are both red
 and green.
  * green - Skills you have yet to purchase
  * red   - Skills you have already purchased and can 'forget' to reimburse
            your APs

 >> Help: Advantage Purchase (Economy Commands)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Syntax: advbuy <advantage>
 Syntax: advdrop <advantage>
 
 Once you have located Ye Olde Augmentation Shoppe in the Spaceport, you use
 the commands 'stats' and 'look augmentation' to view which advantages you
 already have and a list of all the advantages you can buy with their AP
 purchase cost (see 'help AP').
 
 When you 'look augmentation' you'll notice purchase amounts in red and green.
  * green - Advantages you have yet to purchase
  * red   - Advantages you have already purchased and can 'advdrop' to
            reimburse your APs.
	    
 You can only have a maximum of 3 advantages. If you have the proper amount of
 APs, you can use 'advbuy <advantage>' to purchase the advantage listed on
 the Augmentation Interface. Or, if you wish to purchase a different
 advantage, you can use 'advdrop <advantage>' to free up one of your 3 slots
 and receive an immediate reimbursement of APs equal to the listed price of
 the advantage you are dropping.
 
 NOTE: These commands must be done from within Ye Olde Augmentation Shoppe.

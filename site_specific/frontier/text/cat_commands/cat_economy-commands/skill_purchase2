& skill_purchase2
 
 In order to raise a skill, you must have first purchased all the previous
 levels with APs. You cannot, for example, purchase 3+ Gunnery-Laser when you
 have only purchased 5+ Gunnery-Laser. You must first purchase
 4+ Gunnery-Laser before you can raise the skill to 3+.
 
 If you have the proper amount of APs, you can use 'train <skill>' to raise
 the skill level. Or, if you wish to lower the level of one skill to receive
 enough APs to raise another, you can use 'forget <skill>' and receive an
 immediate reimbursement of APs equal to the list price of the skill.
 
 NOTE: These commands must be done from within Ye Olde Augmentation Shoppe.

 Syntax: Baselist/map ('.blm' using the '.add 0' macro)
 
 The 'Genlist' command in its various forms gives you different versions of
 information you need to know about the generators on the Frontier:
 
 - The first form shows you what each generator's energy payout, location,
   range from you, owner, and condition is.
 - The second form shows you a rough sketch of the map outline and the
   location of each generator on the map. All bases have the owner's color
   associated with each base. If a base is in the process of being claimed,
   the abbreviation will flash in the claiming faction's color.

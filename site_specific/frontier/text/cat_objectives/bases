 >> Help: Bases (Objectives)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Function: Bases are the basic unit of territory in the game. Factions battle
 to capture and control bases in order to achieve victory. Bases are also used
 as points for units to deploy from, so having more bases gives your faction
 more room for tactical maneuvering.
 
 Claiming: To capture a base, you must be in a mech or tank weighing at least
 60t and no faster than speed 5/8 (53 kph walk / 86 kph run). Claiming lasts
 for 20 minutes, and can be initiated by simply having your claimer walk over
 the base hex. Claim reward varies depending on the number of friendlies you
 have within claim range (30 hexes).
 
 Interrupting Claim: An enemy can interrupt the claim by defeating you and
 your factionmates, or if the friendly unit holding claim walks out of claim
 range. One friendly unit of any weight or speed (mech, tank, or hover) must
 be within 15 hexes to hold claim (or 10 hexes if enemies are nearby).
 
 Recovery Period: After a base has been captured, the ownership transfers to
 victors, and a 4 minute recovery period begins. Enemies can capture the base
 during this time, but you cannot spawn to defend.

 >> Help: Relays (Gameplay Information)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Function: Relays serve multiple purposes:
 * extend faction's radio range (through the AI channel, your faction can talk
   to a mat on the other side if relay towers are positioned well enough)
 * help defend territory as they have some defense capabilities
 * notifies the faction of incoming enemies within a 30 hex radius
 
 Claiming: (similar to generators) Simply destroy the relay. Relays are armed
 much than generators. If you part of a group of friendlies, and you do not
 fire the final shot, you must be within 15 hexes to receive any claim reward.
 
 Inactivity: After being destroyed, the relay is transferred to your faction's
 ownership and remains destroyed for a period of 15-30 minutes. After or
 during this period of time, if there are no enemies within 15 hexes, the
 relay will automatically repair itself and restart at full health.

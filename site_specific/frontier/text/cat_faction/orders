 >> Help: Orders (Factional Command)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Syntax: Orders
 
 This command shows you the current orders that your faction's high command
 has sent. If it's been a long time since an order has been given in a
 particular field, 'None' is shown since the old order is likely outdated.

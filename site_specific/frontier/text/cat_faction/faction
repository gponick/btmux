 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Factions are the large powers battling for dominance on the Frontier Lands.
 They are more or less 'teams' for our purpose. Factions are typically
 comprised of a number of outfits ('help outfits') and independent players.
 Every once in a while, there will be a refaction that will randomly re-
 distribute the outfits and players into different teams to keep the game
 dynamic and interesting. On the Frontier Lands, there are three teams:
 
  Capellan Confederation
  Lyran Commonwealth
  Draconis Combine
  
 To get around in your faction, you will have to know certain commands and
 information. Related topics are listed below, and all the factional commands
 can be seen by typing 'help faction-commands'. The main gear behind a faction
 is its commanders and officers (see 'help commanders' or 'help officers').
 
 Here is some immediate information to help you out:
 * To talk to people in your faction, type 'fa <message>'.
 * To see who is currently connected, type 'census'.
 * To see a list of factions, type 'factions'.

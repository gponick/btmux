 >> Help: Officers (Factional Information)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Officers are appointed by your faction's Commander, and help the Commander
 to organize the faction's activities. Officers are denoted by a green 'O'
 next to their name on 'census'.
 
 Commands shared between Commanders and Officers are listed when you type
 'ofc' (if you have Commander or Officer status).
 
 For a detailed look at officers, see our online documentation:

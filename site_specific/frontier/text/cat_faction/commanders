 >> Help: Commanders (Factional Information)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 During every refaction, 24-hour elections are held to elect your faction's
 Commander. To vote, simply go to your Re-Spawner room during the time of
 election and look at the new console for details.
 
 To appoint Officers, Commanders must go to their faction's embassy in the
 spaceport's diplomatic district and use the 'Commander Interface' located in
 the Commander's Quarters.
 
 A Commander is the same as an Officer, except that only he/she can set and
 remove officers, and has access to the 'facroster' command and the
 HighCommand channel for all faction Commanders. Commanders are denoted by a
 cyan 'C' next to their name when you type 'census'.
 
 Other commands shared between Commanders and Officers are listed when you
 type 'ofc' (if you have Commander or Officer status).

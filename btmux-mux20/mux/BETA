TinyMUX 2.4:  BETA
Last Update:  September 2004

General Cautions During the Beta Period:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yet again, the work in TinyMUX 2.3 has a different flavor than versions
2.0, 2.1, or 2.2.  Fewer changes have been made to 2.3 than were made
in 2.2.  There were fewer contributors and the flow of contributions was
lower as well.

Please take the time to read the README.  These files should be
helpful to you.  If they are not helpful, then please help us improve
the documentation by by suggesting specific changes.  Documentation bugs
can usually be fixed more rapidly than any other type of bug.

If you port an existing game to this beta:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Make frequent backups.  We cannot stress this enough.  The included 
      Backup script is your friend and should make this process effortless. 
    
    - Make complete backups of all of your config, text, mail, and 
      comsystems.
    
    - Store your backups offsite.  This was always prudent anyway.
    
    - Run your game as usual.
    
    - Report Bugs to brazilofmux@gmail.com following the procedure in README.

      softcode.  This is good coding practice, anyway.

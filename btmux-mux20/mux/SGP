TinyMUX 2.3:  SGP Minimal DB
Last Update:  January 2003
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Sandbox Globals Project(SGP) has been included as part of a minimal
DB with this distribution of MUX.  The current version is 1.0, dated
August 1, 2000, and contains all patches and bugfixes as of 042501.
More information and additional global commands that work with SGP may
be found at:

http://sandbox.erisian.net/sgp/sgpindex.html

Questions about the softcode in use are generally answered at the SGP
website.  There is a web reply form for bug reports, feature requests,
and questions.

The Basics:
----------

  - Included packages in this minimal DB are the SGP Base Globals v1.0,
    SGP RP Pack Globals, and PLACES.

  - The plushelp.txt and staffhelp.txt files for SGP have been
    installed in the mux2.3/game/text directory.

  - The netmux.conf has been modified to include needed configuration
    options for SGP.

  - The master_room is defined as #2.

  - ALL SGP objects are installed and left in the master room.  This is
    totally intentional and done as a means to facilitate the
    installation of additional code that the user may desire.  As
    always, move all non-command objects to either inside the other SGP
    objects or store in a special place for that purpose.

  - Storage has been created, with the password of 'luftroma'. 
	
  * AS ALWAYS, be sure to read the server documentation.

  * Be sure to read about the softcode.

  * CHANGE the passwords for #1 and #3 immediately.

  * Make frequent backups, especially during phases of active coding or
    building.

Otherwise, enjoy.

Ian's stuff:

Did this:

Job 76
Job 54
Job 60
    Even sorts @clist output. Uses MEMALLOC()/MEMFREE(), though,
    since there is no real channel maximum...
    Caps output at 100,000 channels and thus uses 800,000 bytes
    at most.
Job 66
Job 180
    Stupid thing to impliment, but since Penn already did it.. mumble.
    Also, I knocked out the 100-dice limit because lrand() has no
    limit of the sort.
Changed column header spacing to make @list hashstats look more
    appealing.



Things I did last patch yet to be added:
Job 117
Job 119
Job 124
Job 158

Comments:
    Isn't job 179 dead? The only thing not impliment is @assert.. and,
    well, that might as well be @break not(blah).

    Can job 90 already. It's cluttering up the jobs list, and the list
    _seriously_ needs to be cleaned up.

    Job 117 was fixed in my last patched but it never made its way into
    MUX, so I'll include it here... (eventually)

    Same thing with 119, fixed, submitted, ignored/overlooked.

    And job 124.. sigh.

    Get rid of job 215 and 210... And 206.

    Consider axing 221. It's a lot of whining about a minor legacy
    feature and, in all honestly, not worth screwing with to satisfy a
    random whim. Better things to do.

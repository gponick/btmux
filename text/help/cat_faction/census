 >> Help: Census (Factional Command)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Syntax: Census
 Syntax: Census/Spawn
 Syntax: Census/Squad
 
 The 'Census' command displays all currently connected members of your
 faction along with their ranks and current mechs.
 
 The second form, 'Census/Spawn' shows where each pilot that is currently out
 in RS was last spawned from. Please keep in mind the pilot may have moved
 far from what is listed.
 
 The third form is similar to the first but shows people in your squad. All
 members are shown whether they're connected or not, but those who aren't
 appear in dark gray and have a dark red DC in their 'RS' field.

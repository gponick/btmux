 Syntax: Available
 
 This toggles between available and unavailable status. It lets your
 faction-mates know whether you are able to assist in real-space matters by
 displaying a green '+' beside your name on 'census'.
 
 Along with being informational, the total number of people available in
 each faction may be evaluated to when a TinyPlot is being considered.

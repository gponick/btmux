 
& CONNECTED
 
  Flag: CONNECTED (c)
 
  This flag applies only to players and it shows if the
  player is connected or not. Thus, each time you are connected to
  the game, you should see the 'c' flag set; otherwise, you are DEAD!
  You cannot reset this flag, and it is used internally by the code
  for things like tabulating players for the WHO list.

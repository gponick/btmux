 
& ANSI
 
  Flag: ANSI (X)
 
  When set on a player, it will enable the player to see ANSI color.
 
  If you have TinyFugue and you do not wish to see ANSI color, please
  leave this flag set and /set catch_ctrls=ansi. The reason for this
  is when the ANSI flag is unset, the server must go through every 
  line of text you see and strip the ANSI codes from it. With the 
  ANSI flag set and /set catch_ctrls=ansi, TinyFugue will strip the 
  ANSI and save the MUX from having to do it, resulting in less lag 
  for everyone.

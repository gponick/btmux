 
& WIZARD

  Flag: WIZARD (W)

  If a person is WIZARD, they are a wizard, unkillable,
  subject to fewer restrictions, and able to use wizard commands.
  In general, WIZARDs can do anything using #<number> or *<player>.
  Only player #1 can set and unset the WIZARD flag of other players.

  No WIZARD can turn their own WIZARD flag off.  There is probably a
great
  metaphor for life in there somewhere.

  Flag: ROBOT (r)
 
  If set on a player, indicates that the player is a robot and is
  allowed to use the OUTPUTPREFIX and OUTPUTSUFFIX commands that 
  many publicly available robot programs require.  Some MUXes do not 
  restrict access to the OUTPUTPREFIX and OUTPUTSUFFIX commands.
 
  If set on an exit or a thing, indicates that robot players may not
  use the exit or pick up the thing, the player is treated as having 
  failed the lock.

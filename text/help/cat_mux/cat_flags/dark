 
& DARK
 
  Flag: DARK (D)
 
  If a room is DARK, then no items are shown when a person
  'looks' there. If an object is DARK, then "look" does not list that
  object in the room's contents:, and if an exit is DARK, it doesn't
  show up in the Obvious Exits: list.  Puppets and objects that can
  listen cannot be DARK.

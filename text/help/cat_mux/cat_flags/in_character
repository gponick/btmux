 
& IN_CHARACTER
 
  Flag: IN_CHARACTER (#)
 
  The IN_CHARACTER flag is specific to BTMux and denotes IC locations.
  These typically include units, jails, and other areas you generally
  want players to be secluded from the rest of the game. Note that 
  many games don't allow paging or comsys listening/broadcasting 
  from IC locations to prevent the flow of information.
 
  Also, units generally have to be set IC for players to be able to
  gain XP by shooting them.

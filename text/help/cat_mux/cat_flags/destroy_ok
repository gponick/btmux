 
& DESTROY_OK
 
  Flag: DESTROY_OK (d)
 
  When set on an object, it allows any player to destroy
  it as long as the object is not locked against them. This is good
  for things like notes, whereby the recipient can destroy the note
  after reading it, instead of having to look for you to destroy it.
  The DESTROY_OK flag overrides the SAFE flag, so that you do not need
  to give the /override switch to @destroy to destroy a thing that 
  is both DESTROY_OK and SAFE. When it is set on any object or the 
  owner of that object, that object can be destroyed immediately.

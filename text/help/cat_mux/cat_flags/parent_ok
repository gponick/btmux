 
& PARENT_OK
 
  Flag: PARENT_OK (Y)
 
  If an object is set PARENT_OK, then any other object that passes the
  object's ParentLock may make this object a parent of any object that
  it controls. Caution: allowing others to use your objects as 
  parents lets them read the attributes on the object (as well as 
  any parents of the object).

 
& @fpose
 
  Syntax: @fpose[/<switches>] <object>=<message>
 
  Forces <object> to pose <message>.  This command is similar to the
  command '@force <object> = :<message>', except that it will work
  so long as you own the object, whereas @force may fail if the
  object has its INHERIT flag set and the object performing the
  @force does not.
 
  The following switches are available:
     /default - (default) Put a space between the name of the object
                and the message (ie, send '<name> <message>').
     /nospace - Don't put a space between the name of the object and
               the message (ie, send '<name><message>').

 
& @kill
 
  Syntax: @kill <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Kill
 
  This command sets the message that is shown to anyone who kills
  <object>.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for players and things, and will
  never be automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in kill
  messages, and are evaluated when someone kills the object.  In
  function references, 'me' refers to the object that was killed,
  while %-substitutions that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#,
  %p, etc) refer to the player doing the killing.
 
  Example:
  @kill guard = The guard says "I'll get.. you... for...this... %n"
  as he falls down and dies.

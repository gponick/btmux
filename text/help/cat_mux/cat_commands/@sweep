 
& @sweep
 
  Syntax: @sweep[/<switches>]
 
  This command tells you all of the objects, players, and exits that
  are listening in the room you are currently in, as well as the
  objects you are  carrying.  Most objects only listen for a
  particular string or phrase, so they normally do not pose a
  problem if you need privacy.  You will have to be careful of
  players, puppets, and audible exits since they will hear
  everything you say and do.  There are several switches that may be
  used to limit the type of listeners that are checked for.  They
  are:
     /here      - Check the room I am in.
     /inventory - Check my inventory.
     /exits     - Check exits in the room.
 
     /commands  - Check for objects that have $-commands set on them.
     /connected - Check for connected players and their puppets.
     /listeners - Check for objects with @listen set to something.
     /players   - Check for players and their puppets, whether or not
                  they are connected.
 
  The default is to search for everything.  If you specify one or more
  switches from either category (either location or listener type then
  only that location or listener type is checked.

  If you specify a wildcarded attribute name, then only those
  attributes that match are shown.  So, 'exam me/v?' will show all
  your attributes that start with v and are two characters long.
 
  The following switches are available:
     /brief  - Shows everything except attributes.
     /full   - When examining an object you don't control, show any
               public attributes set on the object in  addition to the
               owner's name.
     /parent - Includes attributes that are not present on the object
               itself but which are inherited from the object's
               parent.

 
& @verb
 
  Syntax: @verb <victim>=<actor>, <what>, <def>, <owhat>, <odef>,
  <awhat>, <args>
 
  This command provides a way to do user-defined verbs with associated
  @attr/@oattr/@aattr groups. Invoking it does the following:
 
  <actor> sees the contents of <victim>'s <what> attribute, or
  the <def> string if you can't read <victim>'s <what>   
  attribute.
 
  Everyone in the same room as <actor> sees the contents of
  <victim>'s <owhat> attribute, with <actor>'s name prepended,
  or <odef>, also with <actor>'s name prepended, if you can't read
  <victim>'s <owhat> attribute.
 
  If you control <victim>, then he executes the contents of his
  <awhat> attribute.
 
  By supplying up to nine <args>, you may pass those values on
  the stack (i.e. %0, %1, %2, etc. up through %9).
 
  You must control the actor, but need not control the victim.  Note
  that if you don't have the ability to read the appropriate
  attributes (whether because you control the victim, he is VISUAL,
  or the attributes are set VISUAL), the default messages will be
  used.

 
& @Lalias
 
  Syntax: @lalias <object> = <entrance-list>
  Attribute: Lalias
 
  Sets up a set of alternate commands that may be used as synonynms
  for the command 'leave' when you are inside a player or a thing.
  The alternate commands are separated by semicolons just like in
  exit names.
 
  Leave aliases are checked for after exitnames and builtin MUX
  commands, but before enter aliases and $-commands.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players and things, and will never
  be automatically looked at on rooms or exits.
 
  Example: @lalias car = get out;climb out;out;open door;outside

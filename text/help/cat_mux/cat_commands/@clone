 
& @clone
 
  Syntax: @clone[/<switches>] <object>[=<newname/cost>]
 
  Creates an exact duplicate of <object> that is owned by you and (for
  things and exits) puts it in your current location.  You may have
  the object put in your inventory (or your exitlist in the case of
  cloning exits) by using the /inventory switch.
 
  You may clone your own objects, plus VISUAL objects owned by others.
  The INHERIT and WIZARD bits of the (new) object are cleared when the
  object is cloned.  If <newname> is specified, it is used as the
  name instead of the original name.
 
  If you clone a linked exit, an attempt is made to link the clone to
  the same location.  Except when using the /inventory switch, you
  can only clone exits when you own your current location.
 
  If you clone a room with a drop-to, an attempt is made to link the
  drop-to to the same location.
 
  If the original object was owned by you, then the ACLONE attribute
  is run in the new attribute, otherwise the new object is set
  HALTED.  Exits and contents of cloned objects are not cloned, and
  LOCKED attributes are not copied.

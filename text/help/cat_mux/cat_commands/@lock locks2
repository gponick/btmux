     SpeechLock:   All but Exits:  controls who may speak in that
                                   location (only checked if
                                   AUDITORIUM flag is set on that
                                   location)
     TeloutLock:   All but Exits:  controls who may teleport out of
                                   the location.
     TportLock:    Rooms/Things:   controls who may teleport there if
                                   the location is JUMP_OK.
     UseLock:      All but Exits:  controls who may USE the object,
                                   GIVE the object money and have the
                                   PAY attributes run, have their
                                   messages heard and possibly acted
                                   on by LISTEN and AxHEAR, and invoke
                                   $-commands stored on the object.
     DropLock:     All but rooms:  controls who may drop that object.
     UserLock:     All:            Not used by MUX, is intended to be
                                   used in MUX programming where a
                                   user-defined lock is needed.

  Note: If a player fails the UseLock on a parent of an object being
  searched for $-commands, then the search for attributes stops and
  the parent chain is not searched further for matches.

 
& @oefail
 
  Syntax: @oefail <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Oefail
 
  Sets the message (prefixed by the player's name) that is shown to
  others in the same room as the player when he tries to enter the
  object but fails because the object is not ENTER_OK or the player
  fails the object's enter lock.
 
  The enter lock only affects the 'enter' command and its aliases (set
  via the @ealias command), it does not affect exits that lead to
  the object or teleporting in.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players and things, and will never
  be automatically triggered on rooms or exits.
 
  Example: @oefail car = tries to open the car's door, but it is
  locked.

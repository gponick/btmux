 
& @program2
 
  As you can see, this command basically takes what a user types at
  the prompt, stuffs it into %0 in the code in <obj/attr>, and then
  triggers that attribute. Note that when @program triggers an
  attribute, the enactor of that triggered attribute is <player>,
  and is inserted into %#. r-registers are preserved when @program
  triggers an attribute.
 
  An optional message, <prefix>, may be specified and will be output
  before   the @program prompt. This is useful for telling the user
  what information they need to supply.
 
  A player caught in @program may send a command through to the normal
  command processor at the @program prompt by prefixing it with the
  '|'  character, for example, '|WHO'.

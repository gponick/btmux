 
& @halt
 
  Syntax: @halt [<object>]
 
  Halts all commands being run by <object>, or by the object running
  the command if no <object> is given.  If the object to be halted
  is a player, then all commands being run by objects owned by that
  player are halted.
 
  Use this command to stop runaway objects and infinite loops.
 
  The process of halting an object involves removing all commands
  waiting to be run by the object from the queue and refunding the
  queue deposit.
 
  Halting an object does not affect commands waiting on it as a
  semaphore.

 
& @find
 
  Syntax: @find <name>[,<low>[,<high>]]
 
  Displays the name and number of every room, thing, or player that
  you control whose name matches <name>. Because the command is
  computationally expensive, it costs 100 coins.
 
  <low> and <high> may be used to restrict the range of objects that
  are searched, if they are given then the search starts at object
  #<low> And ends t object #<high>.
 
  Examples:
    > @find Lost Room
    > @find Secret Device,12000,14000

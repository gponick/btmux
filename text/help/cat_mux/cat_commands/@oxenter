  Syntax: @oxenter <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Oxenter
 
  Sets the message (prefixed by the player's name) that is shown to
  others in the location being left when someone enters <object>.
  Note that the message is shown to those outside the object, not
  those inside.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players, things, and rooms, and
  will never be automatically triggered on exits.
 
  Example:
  @oxenter wormhole = climbs into the wormhole and vanishes.

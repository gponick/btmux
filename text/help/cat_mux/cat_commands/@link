 
& @link
 
  Syntax: @link <object>=#<number>/here/home
 
  When used on a player or a thing, this command sets the object's
  home to the indicated location.  The destination must be owned by
  you or be an ABODE room, and you must pass the destination's
  LinkLock.
 
  When used on a room, this command sets the room's drop-to, where
  objects dropped in the room go.  The destination must be a room
  that is either owned by you or is LINK_OK, and you must pass the
  destination's LinkLock.
 
  For exits, this command sets the destination if the exit is
  currently unlinked, you control the destination or it is set
  LINK_OK, and you pass the destination's LinkLock.  You can @link
  an unlinked exit regardless of who owns it or the lock set on it,
  you are made the owner if you successfully link to the destination.
 
  Linking an exit costs 1 coin, and if the exit was owned by someone
  else, you also reimburse the the former owner 1 coin (making the
  total cost to you 2 coins).

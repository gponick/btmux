 
& @sex
 
  Syntax: @sex <object> = <gender>
  Attribute: Sex
 
  Sets the gender for <object>, which is used to determine which
  pronouns to use when replacing %p, %o, %s, and %a parameters in
  messages that apply to <object>.  Genders that start with M or m
  are considered male, those starting with F, f, W, or w are
  considered female, those starting with P or p are considered
  plural, and anything else is considered neuter.
 
  Example:
  @sex me = female
  @sex me = No thank you (Silly, but possible.  Treated as neuter)

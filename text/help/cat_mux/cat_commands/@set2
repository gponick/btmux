 
& @set2
 
  The following flags may be set using the fourth form of the @set
  command:
     no_command - Prevent $-commands and ^-patterns defined in the
     attribute
                  from being performed.
     no_inherit - Prevents children of the object from obtaining the
                  attribute.  From their perspective the attribute
                  does not exist.
     visual     - Anyone may see the attribute when they examine you,
                  and may get the attribute with get().
     hidden     - The attribute is only visable to wizards.
     regexp     - When $-commands are matched, treat the pattern as a
                  regular expression rather than a wildcard glob
                  pattern.
     wizard     - The attribute may only be changed by wizards.
 
  The @set command takes the following switch:
     quiet      - Inhibit 'Set.' acknowledgement messages.

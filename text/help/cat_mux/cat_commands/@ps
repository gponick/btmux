 
& @ps
 
  Syntax: @ps[/<switches>] [<object>]
 
  Lists information about the commands you have on each of the queues.
  Unless the /summary switch is used, this command lists all the
  commands you have on the queues, optionally along with their
  enactor and arguments.
 
  Commands scheduled to be executed at a later time (by the @wait
  command) also show the number of seconds until they will be
  executed and/or the semaphore on which they are waiting.  If
  <object> is specified, only commands run by <object> are listed,
  otherwise all commands run by any of your objects is listed.  A
  summary of the number of commands listed and the total number of
  commands in the queues is also displayed.  This command is
  useful for identifying infinite loops in programs.
 
  The following switches are available:
     /brief   - (default) Display a brief summary that shows the
                semaphore number, time-to-wait, object running the
                command, and the command to be run.
     /long    - In addition to the information in the /brief report,
                display the name and number of the object that caused
                the command to be run (the enactor) and the arguments
                to the command.
     /summary - Display just the queue counts.

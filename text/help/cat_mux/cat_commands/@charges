 
& @charges
 
  Syntax: @charges <object> = <count>
  Attribute: Charges
 
  This attribute allows you to limit the number of times an object can
  be used.  If there is a charges attribute it is decremented each
  time an action on the object is triggered.  Once it reaches zero,
  normal triggering stops and the Runout attribute (if one is
  present) is run instead.
 
  Example:
  @charges Fireball wand = 5

 
& @dig
 
  Syntax: @dig[/<switches>] <name> [= <exitlist> [, <exitlist>] ]
 
  Creates a new room with the specified name and displays its number.
  This command costs 10 coins. If the [= <exitlist>] option is used,
  an exit will be opened from the current room to the new room
  automatically.  If the second <exitlist> option (after the comma)
  is specified, an exit from the new room back to the current room
  with the specified [Exits] name is opened.  Either exit creation
  may fail if you do not have sufficient rights to the current room
  to open or link the new exit.
 
  Example: The command
 
     @dig Kitchen = Kitchen;k;north;n,south;s
 
  will dig a room called Kitchen, and open an exit called 'Kitchen' in
  your current room.  The ; symbol means that you may enter the exit
  by typing 'k', 'north' or 'n' also.  This command also opens the
  exit 'south;s' from 'Kitchen' back to where you are.  Only the
  first Exit name is displayed in the Obvious exits list.
 
  If you specify the /teleport switch, then you are @teleported to the
  room after it is created and any exits are opened.

 
& mail-sending
 
  @mail[/switch] <player-list> = <subject>
  This begins a message to all players in <player-list>.
  -<text> adds text to the message in progress, for example
  -This is a test
  would add the text 'This is a test' to the end of your @mail
  message, likewise, ~<text> prepends the text.

  @mail/send
  This sends the message that is currently in progress.
  -- is the equivalent of @mail/send. @mail/urgent sends
  the message as urgent, and should not be used often.
 
  @mail/cc <player-list>
        This replaces the currect player list with a new one for
        carbon copying. It does _not_ add onto the existing
        list.

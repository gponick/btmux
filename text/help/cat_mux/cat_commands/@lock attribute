& @lock attribute

  ATTRIBUTE LOCKS:

  Key: <attribute>:<pattern>
       +<attribute>:<wildcard-pattern>
       =<attribute>:<wildcard-pattern>

  You may lock on whether a specific attribute on the player
  attempting to pass the lock matches a pattern.  Example: '@lock
  thing=sex:m*' will lock thing to anyone whose sex starts with an M.
  Wild cards, greater than and less than may be used, for example:
  '@lock a-f=name:<g' will lock the exit a-f against any one whose
  name is higher than f.

  Both the player testing the lock and every object in his inventory
  is checked, the player passes the lock if any of those objects
  passes the lock. If the attribute name is prefixed by a = then
  only the player is checked. Similarly, if the attribute name is
  prefixed by a + then only objects in the player's inventory are
  tested.

 
& @otofail
 
  Syntax: @otofail <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Otofail
 
  Sets the message (prefixed by the player's name) that is shown to
  others in  the same room when someone tries to teleport out of
  somewhere they do not have permission.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in teleport
  failure messages, and are evaluated when someone attempts to
  teleport from their location.  In function references, 'me' refers
  to the player's location, while %-substitutions that refer to the
  enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer to the player attempting
  the teleport.
 
  Example:
  @otofail here = thinks about teleporting from the Magic Room, but
  decides against it at the last moment.

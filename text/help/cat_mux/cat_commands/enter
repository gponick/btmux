 
& enter
 
  Syntax: enter[/<switch>] <object>
 
  The enter command is used to enter an object. Insides of objects are
  best used for vehicles, or storage spaces when you don't have a
  home (or even as a floating home).  In order to enter an object
  you must either own it or it must have its ENTER_OK flag set, and
  you must also pass the object's EnterLock (if it has one).
 
  The following switch is recognized:
 
     /quiet   - Don't perform the @oenter/@aenter or @oefail/@aefail
                attributes on the entered object, and don't perform
                the @oxleave attribute on your current
                location.  This switch only works if
                you control the object being entered.

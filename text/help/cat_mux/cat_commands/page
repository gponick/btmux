 
& page
 
  Syntax: page <player-list> [=[<control>]<message>]
 
  This command sends <message> to <player-list>.  If you do not
  specify a name, it defaults to the players you last paged.  You
  may use either the player's name or alias, a list of names and/or
  aliases, and you may also give a string that uniquely matches the
  start of a player's name on the WHO list.
 
  You can format the message one of several ways by specifying ':',
  ';', or '"' as the first character of the message.  ':' and ';'
  format the message as 'From afar, <player> <message>', with ';'
  omitting the space between <player> and <message>.  '"' formats
  the message in normal page format (this is the default).
 
  If your Idle attribute is set to something, then it is sent to
  anyone who successfully pages you.  This is useful for when you
  are away from your terminal for a short while.

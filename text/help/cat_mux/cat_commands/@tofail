 
& @tofail
 
  Syntax: @tofail <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Tofail
 
  Sets the message that a player sees when he tries to teleport from
  somewhere he does not have permission.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in teleport
  failure messages, and are evaluated when someone attempts to
  teleport out of their location.  In function references, 'me'
  refers to the player's current location, while %-substitutions
  that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer to the
  player attempting the teleport.
 
  Example:
  @tofail here = A psychic barrier prevents you from teleporting     
  out.

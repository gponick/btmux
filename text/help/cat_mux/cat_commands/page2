  You can selectively disable pages from certain players with the
  '@lock/page' command (players must pass the lock in order to page
  you).  If someone cannot page you, they will be sent a message
  including of your Reject attribute if they try.  If someone pages
  you while you are not connected, they are sent a message including
  your Away attribute.
 
  You can also page many players at one time, where all the players
you page
  will see the message.
 
  Example:
  > p darkenelf lauren = Hi
  You paged (Darkenelf Lauren) with 'Hi'.
 
  To (Darkenelf Lauren), Dreamline pages: Hi
 
  You only need to type the player-list once, then the next time you
  page that player or set of players, you can abbreviate it with:
  "p :waves."  or, "p I'm back."
 
  This will work until you page another player or list of players.

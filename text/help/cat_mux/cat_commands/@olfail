 
& @olfail
 
  Syntax: @olfail <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Olfail
 
  Sets the message (prefixed by the player's name) that is shown to
  others in the same room as the player when he tries to leave it
  but fails because the player fails the object's leave lock.
 
  The leave lock only affects the 'leave' command and its aliases (set
  via the @ealias command), it does not affect going home, using an
  exit in the location, or teleporting out.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players and things, and will never
  be automatically triggered on rooms or exits.
 
  Example:
  @olfail plane = thinks about jumping out of the plane without a
  parachute, but wisely reconsiders.

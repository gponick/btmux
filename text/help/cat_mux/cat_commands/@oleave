  Syntax: @oleave <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Oleave
 
  Sets the message (prefixed by the player's name) that is shown to
  others in the location being left when someone leaves <object>.
  Note that the message is shown to those inside the object, not
  those outside.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players, things, and rooms, and
  will never be automatically triggered on exits.
 
  Example: @oleave wormhole = departs the wormhole to return to normal
  space.

  @mail <msg #>
  @mail/read <msg-list>
        This displays messages which match the msg# or msg-list from
        your current folder.
 
  @mail
  @mail <msg-list, but not a single msg #>
        This gives a brief list of all mail in the current folder,
        with sender name, a list of receiving players, subject, and
        message status.
  @mail/list [<msg-list>]
        This gives the same list, but with time sent instead of
        subject.
        The status field is a set of characters (ex: NC-UF+) which
        mean:
                N = New (unread) message
                C = Cleared message
                U = Urgent message
                F = Forwarded message
                + = Tagged message
        The opposites of these (read messages, etc.) are indicated
        with a '-' in the status field in that position.

 
& @cset
 
  Syntax: @cset/<option> <channel>
 
  Changes the way a channel behaves.  <option> can be one of the
  following: public, private, loud, mute, quiet, object.
 
  Public makes it show up on everyone's @clist, private hides it.
  Loud makes it announce connects/disconnects.  Mute/quiet, shuts
  them off.
 
  The object switch sets the channel object to whatever you specify.
  It will allow you to set a description for the @clist, by @descing
  the  object.  Also, the lock will be used to check to see if people
  should be able to join the channel or not.
 
  See help channel object for more.

 
& @cpflags
 
  Syntax: @cpflags <channel>=[!]flag
 
  Sets player flags for that channel. The flag can be one of: join,
  transmit, or receive.
 
  Transmit: Whether a player can broadcast things over the channel.
  Join: Whether a player can join the channel.
  Receive: Whether a player can receive messages over the channel.
 
  If it is !flag, then that flag is reset. Note that channel flags
  ALWAYS override locks on channel objects.

 
& @switch
 
  Syntax: @switch[/<switches>] <string>=<t1>,<c1> [,<tN>,<cN>]...
          [,<cD>]
 
  Compares <string> against the targets <t1>, <t2>, etc, until a match
  is found, at which time the corresponding list of commands is
  performed.
 
  Wildcards, and the < and > operators are allowed in the targets.  By
  default, any list whose target matches the string is executed (the
  targets are not mutually exclusive). If no target matches, the
  default list <cD> is executed.
 
  The following switches are available:
     /all   - (default) Perform the actionlists associated with all
              targets that match <string>.
     /first - Perform only the actionlist associated with the first
              target that matches <string>.

 
& @open
 
  Syntax: @open[/<switches>] <direction list> [=<number>[,<direction
  list>]]
 
  Creates an exit in the specified direction(s). If <number> is
  specified, it is linked to that room. Otherwise, it is created
  unlinked. You or anyone else may use the '@link' command to
  specify where the unlinked exit leads.
 
  Opening an exit costs 1 coin. If you specify <number>, linking costs
  1 more coin.  You can specify a second direction list (after the
  comma), which is automatically opened in the room that the new
  exit goes TO and which is linked back to where you are.  I.e.
  @open north;n=#1234,south;s would open exit 'north;n' from here to
  #1234, and an exit 'south;s' from #1234 to here, assuming you have
  rights to open exits and link to the rooms in question.
 
  The following switches are available:
     /location  - Create the exit in your location (default).
     /inventory - Create the exit on yourself.

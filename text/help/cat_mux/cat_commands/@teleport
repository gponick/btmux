 
& @teleport
 
  Syntax: @teleport [<object>=] <room/thing>
           @teleport [<object>=] <exit>
           @teleport [<object>=] home
 
  The first form of the @teleport command moves <object> (or you) to
  the named room or thing.  The second form sends <object> (or you)
  to the destination of the named exit, while the third form sends
  <object> (or you) home.
 
  If the destination room has a drop-to, the object will go to the
  drop-to instead of the named location.
 
  For the first form of the @teleport command, the object being
  teleported must pass its location's TeloutLock; and you must
  control the destination, or it must be JUMP_OK and you must pass
  the destination's TportLock.
 
  The second and third forms let you remove any object from locations
  you control by sending them through an exit or to their home.
 
  The following switch is available:
     /quiet - Teleports without setting off success or failure
              messages.

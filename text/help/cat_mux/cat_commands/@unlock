 
& @unlock
 
  Syntax: @unlock <object>
          @unlock <object>/<attrib>
 
  The first form removes the lock on <object>, so that anyone may pass
  through (if an exit) or pick it up (if a player or an object).
 
  The second form clears the locked flag on the indicated attribute of
  the named object.  This allows the attribute to change ownership
  to the new owner automatically when the object is @chowned, and
  allows the owner of the object to @chown the attribute to themself
  or to overwrite it.
 
  You must own the attribute to be unlocked, but you do not need to
  own the object.

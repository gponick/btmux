 
& @ealias
 
  Syntax: @ealias <object> = <entrance-list>
  Attribute: Ealias
 
  Sets up a set of alternate commands that may be used as synonynms
  for the command 'enter <object>' when you are in the same location
  as the object.
 
  The alternate commands are separated by semicolons just like in exit
  names.
 
  Entry aliases are checked for after exitnames, builtin MUX commands,
  and leave aliases for the current location, but before $-commands.
  If more than one object has an entry alias that matches a player's
  command, the one on the object that occurs first in the location
  contents list is used.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players and things, and will never
  be automatically looked at on rooms or exits.
 
  Example:
  @ealias car = get in car; car; climb in; go for a ride
 
  See also: @lalias, enter, leave

 
& @drop
 
  Syntax: @drop <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Drop
 
  Sets the message that a player sees when he drops the object, or
  after he goes through the exit.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in drop
  messages, and are evaluated when someone drops the object.  In
  function references, 'me' refers to the object being dropped,
  while %-substitutions that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#,
  %p, etc) refer to the dropper.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for players and things, and will
  never be automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Examples:
  <object> @drop vase = You gently put down the delicate vase.
  <exit>   @drop elevator = The elevator doors close behind you.

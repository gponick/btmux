 
& @enter
 
  Syntax: @enter <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Enter
 
  Sets the message that a player sees when entering an object or room,
  whether by using an exit, the enter or leave commands, or by
  teleporting.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in enter
  messages, and are evaluated when someone enters the object.  In
  function references, 'me' refers to the object being entered, while
  %-substitutions that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p,
  etc) refer to the player entering the object.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players, things, and rooms, and
  will never be automatically triggered on exits.
 
  Example:
  @enter car = You climb into the car and buckle your seatbelt.

 
& @rfail
 
  Syntax: @rfail <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Rfail
 
  Sets the message that a player sees when he tries to give an object
  to someone else, but the receiver refuses to accept the object
  because the object didn't pass its receive lock.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in receive
  failure  messages, and are evaluated when someone tries to give
  away the object. In function references, 'me' refers to the
  intended recipient of the object, while %-substitutions that refer
  to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer to the (attempted)
  giver.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for players and things, and will
  never be automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Example:
  @gfail merchant = The merchant doesn't want your worthless trash.

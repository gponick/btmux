  Syntax: @malias
 
  This allows you to generate and maintain mailing lists with the mail
  system. All mail aliases start with '*', and are case-sensitive.
  (*dir is different than *Dir).  There are two kinds of mail
  aliases, Personnal and Global. Global mailing lists are owned and
  maintained by the god (#1) char and are available for anyone to
  use.  Generally there will be *Wizards, *Admin, *Roleplay, and
  things of that nature.  Personal mailing aliases are mailing lists
  that you have defined with the @malias commad.
 
  Currently there is no limit to the number of people you can have on
  a mailing alias.
 
  To begin sending mail to a mailing list, use @mail *<alias>=subject.
 
  Usage:
 
  @malias                   Displays a list of all mail aliases.
  @malias *<alias>          Displays a list of people on that alias.
  @malias *<alias>=<list>   Creates that mailing list, using <list>.

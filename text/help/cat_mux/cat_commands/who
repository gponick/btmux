 
& WHO
 
  Syntax: WHO <prefix>
 
  Displays a list of players currently connected to the MUX.
  The WHO report tells you how long a player has been on, how long
  they have been inactive, and what they are doing (if they have
  used the @doing  command).  If <prefix> is specified, only players
  whose names start with  <prefix> are listed.  The WHO command must
  be entered in all capitals.

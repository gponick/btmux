  @mail/proof
	This shows you the message that is currently in progress, as
	it would be read by whomever received it.
 
  @mail/edit <old text> = <new text>
  Like @edit, but edits the message in process.
 
  @mail/abort
  This aborts the message currently in progress, allowing you
  to start a new one.
 
  @mail/fwd <msg> = <player-list>
        This sends a copy of <msg> to all the players in
        <player-list>.
        The copy will appear to have been sent by you (not the
        original sender), and its status will be "Forwarded".
        Note that this places the message to be forwarded into
        your mail buffer, where you can edit it with @mail/edit, add
        text with '-', or prepend text with '~'. You have to
        use '--' or @mail/send to send the message.
 
  @mail/quick <player-list>/<subject> = <message>
  Sends <message> to the list of players.

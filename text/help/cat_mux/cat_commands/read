 
& read
 
  Syntax: read [<object>]
 
  Displays the description of <object>, or the room you're in if you
  don't specify an object.  Specifying object as <name> or #<dbref>
  or 'me' or 'here' is legal.  You can also use look to look at
  objects held by other people, just use 'read <person>'s <object>'.
 
  You may use the /outside switch to look at the location of your
  current location (useful if you are inside a vehicle or other
  object).  You may also look at other objects in the 'outer'
  location, but you may not use the possessive form with the
  /outside switch (ie: "read/outside <person>'s <object>" won't
  work).
 
  NOTE: 'look' is the same as 'read'.

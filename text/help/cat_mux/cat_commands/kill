 
& kill
 
  Syntax: kill <player> [=<cost>]
 
  Attempts to kill the specified player. Killing costs <cost> coins,
  which gives you a <cost>% chance of killing the player. Thus,
  spending 100 coins always works (except against wizards and
  immortals, who can never be killed). Players cannot be killed in
  rooms which have been set HAVEN or which they control.  If you
  don't specify a cost, the default is 10 (for a 10% chance of
  success).  The player, if killed, receives <cost>/2 coins in
  insurance.

 
& @create
 
  Syntax: @create <name> [=<cost>]
 
  Creates a thing with the specified name.  Creation costs either
  <cost> or 10 coins, whichever is greater. The value of a thing is
  proportional to its cost, specifically, value=(cost/5)-1.  The
  value may not be greater than 100, values that would be greater
  than 100 are rounded down to 100.

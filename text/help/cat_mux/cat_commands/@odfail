 
& @odfail
 
  Syntax: @odfail <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Odfail
 
  Sets the message (prefixed by the player's name) that is shown to
  others in  the same room when someone tries to drop <object> but
  fails because they didn't pass the object's drop lock.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in drop failure
  messages, and are evaluated when someone drops the object.  In
  function references, 'me' refers to the object being dropped,
  while %-substitutions that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#,
  %p, etc) refer to the dropper.
 
  Example:
  @odfail sword = tries to put down the sword but it leaps back
  into %p hand.

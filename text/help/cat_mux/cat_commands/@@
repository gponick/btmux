  Syntax: @@ <args>
 
  This command does nothing, therefore it is useful for putting
  comments into a MUX program.  Be careful that ()'s and {}'s in the
  (otherwise ignored) arguments are nested correctly, lest your
  command-ending ; be trapped inside.
 
  Example:
  @va me=$foobar *:@fo #1234=%0;@@ This controls my foobar puppet.

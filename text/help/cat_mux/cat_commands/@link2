 
& @link2
 
  Note that in all the above cases that it is the player performing
  the @link command that must pass the LinkLock, not the object
  being linked. Therefore, you should use the '$' lock qualifier if
  you want to prevent specific players from linking to your LINK_OK
  locations, as simply locking against '*<playername>' does not lock
  out their puppets.

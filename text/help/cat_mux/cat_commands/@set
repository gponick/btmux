 
& @set
 
  Syntax: @set[/<switch>] <object>=[!]<flag>
           @set[/<switch>] <object>=<attribute>:<value>
           @set[/<switch>] <object>=<attribute>:_<fromobj>/<fromattr>
           @set[/<switch>] <object>/<attr>=[!]<attrflag>
 
  The first form sets (or clears) the indicated flag on <object>, the
  second form sets the <attribute> attribute on <object> to <value>,
  creating a new user-named attribute if there is no attribute named
  <attribute>.  The third form copies an attribute from another
  object, and the fourth form sets (or clears) an attribute flag on
  the <attr> attribute of <object>.
 
  When setting attributes on an object, you may also use the command
  '@<attribute> <object> = <value>' if the attribute is a predefined
  attribute.  You may also use the command '&<attribute> <object> =
  <value>' to set either predefined attributes or user-named
  attributes. Either of these is equivalent to the second form of
  the @set command.

  Syntax: goto[/<switch>] <direction>
           goto[/<switch>] home
           <direction>
           home
 
  Moves you in the specified direction, assuming that the direction is
  not locked against you.  'move home' is a special command that
  returns you to your home. The word 'move' may be omitted.
 
  The following switch is recognized:
     /quiet   - Don't perform the @osucc/@asucc/@odrop/@adrop or
                @ofail/@afail attributes on the exit being used.  This
                switch only works if you control the exit.
 
  NOTE: 'move' is the same as 'goto'.

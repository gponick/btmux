 
& @notify
 
  Syntax: @notify[/<switches>] <object>[/<attribute>][=<count>]
 
  Notifies the semaphore <object>, running the first command that
  waited on <object> using the '@wait <object>=<command>' or '
  @wait <object>/<time>=<command>' forms of the @wait command.  If
  <count> is specified, it indicates the number of times the
  semaphore is notified.
 
  If there are no commands (or less than <count> commands) pending for
  <object>, then subsequent @waits will not block until the semaphore
  count reaches zero again. @notify may also take an argument of the
  form <object>/<attribute>, which notifies commands that are being
  blocked on an attribute other than the default 'Semaphore'. This
  allows blocking of muliple sets of commands on a single object,
  using different attributes.
 
  The following switches are available:
     /first - (default) Notify the first command waiting on the
              indicated semaphore (or the first <count> commands).
     /all   - Notify all commands waiting on the semaphore and reset
              the semaphore count to zero.  <count> is ignored.

 
& channel object
 
  In the comsystem, you may specify a channel object for each channel.
  (@cset/object channel=<object>).
  
  Channel objects allow you to specify a description for a channel,
  and place certain restrictions on joining, transmitting, and 
  receiving.
 
  NOTE: If a channel flag is set by @cpflags/@coflags, it will ALWAYS
  override the equivalent lock. The flags are set by default, so you
  will have to clear them before your locks work.
 
  The join lock for a channel is a normal @lock on the channel object. 
  The transmit lock for a channel is a use @lock on the channel
  object.
  The receive lock for a channel is an enter @lock on the channel
  object.
  The description of a channel is the @desc of the channel object.

 
& ZONES4
 
  More possible uses for zones:
 
  3. If local wizards are desired, a zone object may be created and
  enter locked to the local wizard. Players building within 
  that zone should  be @chzone'd to that ZMO. The local wizard 
  will then be able to control anything within that domain.
 
  4. If you want restricted global commands defined over only a
  small area, you can define that area to be part of a zone, 
  and place the desired $commands upon the ZMO.

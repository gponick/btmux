 
& parent rooms
 
  Parent rooms are a subset of zones. If a room is used as as zone
  object, it is a parent room (PR). PRs are like local "master" 
  rooms. Exits in the PR are global to that zone, and $commands on 
  objects in the PR are global to that zone. Parent rooms are only 
  defined if globals are used.
  
  Parent rooms should only be used for very large zones which have a
  lot of global exits. Otherwise, a ZMO thing should be used, 
  because command evaluation on a parent room is slower than command 
  evaluation on a ZMO.
  
  Large numbers of parent rooms may slow down the game significantly.

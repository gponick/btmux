 
& ZONES2
 
  Anyone who can pass the Enter lock of the ZMO has control over all
  objects in that zone. This, in essence, gives that player wizard
  powers within that zone. For this reason, one must be extremely
  careful with the enter locks of ZMOs!
 
  Also, $commands on a ZMO are treated as global within that zone.
  The game attempts to match $commands for the ZMO of the player's
  location, as well as $commands for the player's own zone.
  
  For some suggestions on how to use zones, see "help ZONES3".

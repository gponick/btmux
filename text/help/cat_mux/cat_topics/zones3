 
& ZONES3
 
  Some suggested uses of zones:
  1. If you are working on a building project with several people, it 
  may be useful to create a zone object and @elock it to all of you, 
  and ask a  wizard to @chzone the players involved to the zone 
  object. That way, all of the  players working on the project will 
  be able to modify the building.

  2. On a similar thread, if several players are working on a project 
  involving only a few objects, it may be simpler to create a zone 
  object and @chzone those few objects to the ZMO instead of 
  resetting the zones of the players. Note that a player does not 
  have to belong to a zone in order to change objects in that zone; 
  all is merely required to pass the ZMO's enter lock.

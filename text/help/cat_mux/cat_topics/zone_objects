  ZONE OBJECTS
 
  Zones are areas of the MUX which may be controlled by many people.
  Essentially, they allow group ownership of objects.
 
  The default zone is NOTHING. Any building done by a player defaults
  to belonging to the same zone that the player belongs to.
  Every zone is defined by a Zone Master Object (ZMO). The ZMO is an
  ordinary MUX object owned by some player. A wizard may change the
  zone of an object or player to a ZMO.
 
  If the ZMO is a room, it is called a "Parent room." Most of the
  statements about ZMOs also apply to parent rooms; for details,
  see the help topic PARENT ROOMS.

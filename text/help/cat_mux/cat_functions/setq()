 
& setq()
 
  Syntax: setq(<number>,<string>)
 
  This function is used to copy strings into local registers. It
  returns a null string; it is a purely "side effect" function. There
  are ten local registers, numbered 0 through 9. They are cleared at
  the start of each interactive command, but are preserved across the
  command queue. They are most useful for storing complex function
  evaluations which are used repeatedly within a single command. The
  local registers may be read via the r() function, and a common use
  of setq()/r() is to temporarily store the result of a complex
  evaluation whose result is needed more than once.
 
  setq() can be used to improve the readability of MUX code, as well
  as to cut down the amount of time needed to do complex evaluations.
 
  Example:
  >&TEST me=Test on [mudname()] at [time()].
  > say [setq(0,u(TEST))]'[r(0)]' has length [strlen(r(0))].
  You say "'Test on TestMUX at Tue Feb 23 17:00:51 1993.' has length
  45."

 
& r()
 
  Syntax: r(<number>)
 
  This function is used to access "local registers", and returns the
  contents of the specified register. There are ten such registers,
  numbered 0 through 9.
 
  The local registers are normally cleared at the start of each
  command, but are preserved across the commands that compose an
  actionlist, as well as commands that directly trigger actionlists,
  such as @switch, @trigger, and @dolist.

 
& u()
 
  Syntax: u([<obj>/]<attr>[,<arg>]...)
 
  The u function evaluates an attribute, either from the object
  performing the function or from another object you own, passing in
  arguments and returning the result.
 
  When evaluating the fetched attribute, %# refers to the original
  enactor and not the 'calling' object, and 'me' refers to the object
  that supplied the attribute.
 
  Example:
 
  > @va me=Word is [extract(v(vb),add(%0,1),1)], arg2 is %1.
  > @vb me=This is a test of the u function.
  > say u(va,4,Testing 123)
  You say "Word is of, arg2 is Testing 123."
  > say u(va,7)
  You say "Word is function., arg2 is ."
  > say u(me/va,6,Foobar)
  You say "Word is u, arg2 is Foobar."

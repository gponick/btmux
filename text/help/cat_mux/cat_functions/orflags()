 
& orflags()
 
  Syntax: orflags(<object>,<list of flags>)
 
  This function returns 1 if <object> has at least one of the flags in
  a specified list, and 0 if it does not. The list is specified with a
  single letter standing for each flag, like the output of the
  flags() function. A '!' preceding a flag letter means "not flag".
 
  Thus, orflags(me,Wr) would return 1 if I am set WIZARD or ROYALTY.
  orflags(me,D!c) would return 1 if I am DARK or not CONNECTED.
 
  If a letter does not correspond to any flag, <object> doesn't have
  it, so it is simply ignored. There can be an arbitrary number of
  flags.
 
  Warning: Do not put spaces between flag letters.

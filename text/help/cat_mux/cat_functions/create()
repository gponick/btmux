 
& create()

  Syntax: create(<object>, <cost>[, <type>])

  Works the same as @create <object>, but returns the database number
  of the object created. <cost> is the cost of making the object.
  <type> is an optional parameter:

  'r' for rooms,
  't' for things, and
  'e' for exits.

  If no <type> is specified, then a thing will be created by default.

  See Also: @create.

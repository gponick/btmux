 
& pmatch()
 
  Syntax: pmatch(<string>)
 
  Given the partial name of a player, it returns that player's dbref
  number. This partial name completion works identically to the
  partial name completion of the page command - i.e. it first
  attempts to match the normal names of all players (connected or
  not), and if that fails, it tries to match the partial names of
  connected players. If no player is matched, it returns "#-1". If
  more than one match is possible for a partial name, it returns "#-
  2".
 
  The function will also accept *<player> or #<db#>. If given a non-
  player dbref #, pmatch() will return #-1.

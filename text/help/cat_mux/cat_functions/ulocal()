 
& ulocal()
 
  Syntax: ulocal([<obj>/]<attr>[,<arg>]...)
 
  The ulocal() function is almost identical to u() in Syntax: it
  evaluates an attribute, either from the object performing the
  function, or another object that you control or has the same owner
  as you, passing in arguments and returning the result. When
  evaluating the fetched attribute, %# refers to the original enactor
  and not the 'calling' object; 'me' refers to the object that
  supplied the attribute.
 
  However, unlike the u() function, the global registers r(0) through
  r(9) (%q0 - %q9) are preserved in their initial state. This means
  that functions "below" the level of the u() can reset global
  registers for temporary calculations, without needing to worry about
  "clobbering" the original values.
 
  This makes ulocal() particularly useful for global or shared code
  which calls arbitrary u() functions, where global register values
  need to be preserved from accidental user clobbering.

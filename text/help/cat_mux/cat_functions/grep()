 
& grep()
 
  Syntax: grep(<object>,<attrs>,<pattern>)
 
  This function returns a list of attributes on <object> containing
  <pattern>. <attrs> is a wildcard pattern for attribute names to
  search; if you want to search all attributes, use "*".
 
  Parsing does occur before this function is invoked. Therefore,
  "special" characters will need to be escaped out. <pattern> is not
  wildcard matched. This function is case-sensitive. grepi() is a case
  insensitive version.

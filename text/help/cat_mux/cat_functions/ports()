 
& ports()
 
  Syntax: ports(<player name>)
 
  This function returns the list of descriptors ("ports") that a
  player, specified by full player name, or by dbref, is connected to.
  Only Wizards may use this function; if a user lacks the privileges,
  or the player is not connected, an empty list is returned.
  Otherwise, a list of ports is returned in order of most recent
  connection to least recent connection. These ports correspond to
  those given by the session command.

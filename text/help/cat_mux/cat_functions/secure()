 
& secure()
 
  Syntax: secure(<string>)
 
  Returns <string> after replacing the characters [](){};%\$ with
  spaces. This prevents strings entered by players from causing
  undesired side effects when used, such as making your object
  perform unintended commands or give out information to which you
  have access.
 
  Note: This function is only needed when the resulting string is to
  be passed through the @force command or be used as an attribute for
  an object (like the success message for a mail message object).
 
  Example:
  > @va me=Sneak a peek at Wiz's desc... [get(#1/desc)]
  > say secure(%va)
  You say "Sneak a peek at Wiz's desc...  get #1/desc  "
  > say secure($foobar:this {is} a really, tough ; test.)
  You say " foobar:this is a really tough   test."
 
  Note: 'say secure(Sneak a peek at Wiz's desc... [get(#1/desc)])'   
  does not produce the expected result because the argument is   
  evaluated before being processed by secure(), therefore the get()  
  call has already been performed.

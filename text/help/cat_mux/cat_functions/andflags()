 
& andflags()
 
  Syntax: andflags(<object>,<list of flags>)
 
  This function returns 1 if <object> has all the flags specified,
  and 0 if it does not. The list is specified with a single letter
  standing for each flag, like the output of the flags() function.
  A '!' preceding a flag letter means "not flag".
 
  If a letter does not correspond to any flag, <object> doesn't have
  it, so the function returns 0.
 
  There can be an arbitrary number of flags. Do not put spaces between
  flag letters.
 
  Example:
  Given that #1234 is a character with the WIZARD and DARK flags set
 
  >ANDFLAGS(#1234,WD)
  1
  >ANDFLAGS(#1234,W!D)
  0

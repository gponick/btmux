 
* get_eval()
 
  Syntax: get(<object>/<attribute>)
 
  This function returns the value of <attribute> on <object>, in
  similar fashion to get(). However get_eval() performs function
  references and $-substitutions. In function references, 'me' refers
  to the object being looked at, and -substitutions that refer to the
  enactor (such as %n, %#, etc) refer to the object making the
  get_eval call. If the attribute is not present on <object>, its
  parent is searched for the attribute.
 
  Example:
 
  > @va test = This is a get_eval test on %n.  The vb is [get(me/vb)]
  > @vb test = VB from test
  > @vb me = VB from me
  > say get(test/va)
  You say "This is a get_eval test on %n. The vb is [get(me/vb)]"
  > say get_eval(test/va)
  You say "This is a get_eval test on Foobar. The vb is VB from test"

 
& locate()2
 
  If nothing matches, the value #-1 is returned. If more than one
  thing of the preferred type matches, but nothing matches exactly,
  the value #-2 is returned, except if the X qualifier was specified
  in which case one is chosen at random. If more than one thing
  exactly matches, one is chosen at random. If you specify more than
  one type preference (E, P, R, or T), then the last one entered is
  the one that is obeyed. The default is for no type to be preferred.
 
  Example:

  > say locate(me,test,n)                > say locate(here,tes,*)
  You say "#382"                         You say "#382"
  > say locate(me,test1,in)              > say locate(me,out,e)
  You say "#378"                         You say "#252"

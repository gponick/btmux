 
& s()
 
  Syntax: s(string)
 
  This function performs pronoun substitution in a string, and then
  returns that string. As usually, %n is the name, %s the subjective
  pronoun, %o the objective, %p the possessive, and %a the absolute
  possessive. It is important to note that the pronoun is that of the
  triggering object.
 
  So, if the attribute ve of an object were: s(This is %n), and I were
  to type @trigger <object>/ve, it would return "This is <myname>",
  but if attribute vf were @trigger me/ve, then triggering the
  attribute vf makes the Attribute ve return "This is <object>".

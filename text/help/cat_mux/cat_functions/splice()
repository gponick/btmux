 
& splice()
 
  Syntax: splice(<list1>, <list2>, <word>[, <delim>])
 
  This function splices <list1> and <list2> together. <list1> and
  <list2> are space-separated lists of words
 
  If a word in <list1> is the same as <word>, it is replaced by the
  word in the corresponding position in <list2>. Both lists must have
  the same number of words. <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter
  other than a space.
 
  Example:
  > say splice(foo bar baz,eek moof gleep,bar)
  You say, "foo moof baz"

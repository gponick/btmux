 
& peek()
 
  Syntax: peek([<object>], [<position>])
 
  This function returns an item from the caller's stack without
  removing it from the stack. If <position> is specified, it returns
  the item from that position in the stack (items in the stack are
  numbered with 0 being the most recently push()ed item), otherwise,
  it returns position 0.
 
  If <object> is specified and you control it, then it returns an item
  from <object>'s stack.

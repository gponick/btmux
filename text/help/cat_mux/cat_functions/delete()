 
& delete()

  Syntax: delete(<string>,<first>,<len>)

  Returns <string>, but with <len> characters starting after the
  character at position <first> removed.  In other words, this
  function copies <first> characters, skips <len> characters, and
  then copies the remainder of the string.

  Example:
    > say delete(abcdefgh, 3, 2)
    You say "abcfgh"
    > say delete(Would you like coffee or perhaps tea?, 15, 18)
    You say "Would you like tea?"

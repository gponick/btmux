 
& escape()
 
  Syntax: escape(<string>)
 
  Returns <string> after adding an escape character (\) at the start
  of the string and also before each of the characters %;[]{}\ that
  appear in the string. This prevents strings entered by players from
  causing undesired side effects when used, such as making your
  object perform unintended commands or give out information to which
  you have access.
 
  Note that this function is only needed when the resulting string is
  to be passed through the @force command or be used as an attribute
  for an object (like the success message for a mail message object).
  This function has the advantage over the secure() function in that
  the string the user sees after evaluating it is the same as the
  original string.
 
  Example:
 
  You say "\Sneak a peek at Wiz's desc... \[get(#1/desc)\]"
 
  Note: 'say escape(Sneak a peek at Wiz's desc... [get(#1/desc)])'
  does not produce the expected result because the argument is
  evaluated BEFORE being processed by escape(), therefore the get()
  call has already been performed.

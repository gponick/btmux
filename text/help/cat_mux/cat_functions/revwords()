 
& revwords()
 
  Syntax: revwords(<string>[, <delim>])
 
  Reverses the order of the words of <string>. A word is considered to
  be any sequence of nonblank characters, separated by blanks, so
  punctuation characters that follow a word are considered part of
  the word. <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than a
  space.
 
  Example:
 
  > say revwords(This is a test, Really...)
  You say "Really... test, a is This"
  > say revwords(Was it a cat I saw?)
  You say "saw? I cat a it Was"

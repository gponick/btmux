 
& eval()
 
  Syntax: eval(<object>,<attribute>)
  Syntax: eval(<string>)
 
  The first form of the eval function works exactly like the
  get_eval() function, but takes the object and attribute in two
  seperate arguments instead of an obj/attr pair. It is mainly used
  for compatibility with PennMUSH 1.50.
 
  The second form simply evaluates <string>. This is normally done
  when a function is called, however, it is useful in evaluating %q
  and %v substitutions.

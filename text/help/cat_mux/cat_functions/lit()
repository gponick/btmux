 
& lit()
 
  Syntax: lit(<string>)
 
  This function returns the string literally - without even squishing
  spaces, and without evaluating *anything*. This can be useful for
  writing ASCII maps with spaces or whatever. It can be a bit tricky
  to get a literal string with spaces into an attrib, however, since
  spaces are usually squished in setting an attribute.
 
  Example:
 
  > @va me=$test: think {[lit(near       far)]}
  Set.
  > ex me/va
  VA [#1]: $test: think {[lit(near       far)]}
  > test
  near       far
 
  Note: Leaving out the {}'s will not work in the above.

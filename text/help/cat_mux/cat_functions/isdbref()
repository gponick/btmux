 
& isdbref()
 
  Syntax: isdbref(<string>)
 
  This function will return 1 if the string passed to it is a valid
  dbref. To be a valid dbref the string must begin with '#' and be
  followed by an integer. Also, the dbref must exist in the current
  database as a valid object. If the object fails either of these
  criteria, then a 0 is returned.
 
  Example:
 
  > say isdbref(#-1)
  You say "0"
  > say isdbref(#1)
  You say "1"
  > say isdbref(This is not a dbref)
  You say "0"

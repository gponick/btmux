 
& insert()
 
  Syntax: insert(<list>, <pos>, <word>[, <sep>])
 
  This function inserts a word into <list> so that the word becomes
  the <pos>'th element of the list, and all subsequent list elements
  are moved down. This means that it appears between the <pos-1>'th
  and <pos>'th elements of the original list. This function may also
  be used to append a word to a list.
 
  <delim> may be used to specify a delimiter other than a space.
 
  Example:
 
  > say insert(This is a test, 4, new)
  You say "This is a new test"
  > say insert(Yet@Another@List, 3, Funky, @)
  You say "Yet@Another@Funky@List"

 
& munge()
 
  Syntax: munge([<object>/]<attribute>,<list 1>,<list
2>[,<delimiter>])
 
  This function takes two lists of equal length. It passes the
  entirety of <list 1> to the user-defined function as %0. Then, this
  resulting list is matched with elements in <list 2>, and the
  rearranged <list 2> is returned. This is useful for doing things
  like sorting a list, and then returning the correspoding elements
  in the other list. If a resulting element from the user-defined
  function doesn't match an element in the original <list 1>, a
  corresponding element from <list 2> does not appear in the final
  result.
 
  For example: Consider attribute PLACES, which contains "Fort Benden
  Ista", and another attribute DBREFS contains the dbrefs of the main
  JUMP_OK location of these areas, "#20 #9000 #5000". We want to
  return a list of dbrefs, corresponding to the names of the places
  sorted alphabetically. The places sorted this way would be "Benden
  Fort Ista", so we want the final list to be "#9000 #20 #5000". The
  functions, using munge(), are simple:
 
  > &sort_alpha me=[sort(%0)]
  > say [munge(sort_alpha,v(places),v(dbrefs))]
  You say, "#9000 #20 #5000"

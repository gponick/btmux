 
& search()
 
  Syntax: search([<player>] [<class>=<restriction>[,<low>[,<high>]]])
 
  This function returns a list of objects that match the search
  criteria, which are the same as with the @search command. This
  function costs as much as the @search command, so repeated use is
  expensive.
 
  Warning: if you use the [ and ] characters in an Eval selection you
  will need to escape them.
 
  Example:
  > say search()
  You say "#226 #289 #325 #364 #368 #369"
  > @stats me
  6 objects = 0 rooms, 0 exits, 5 things, 1 players. (0 garbage)
  > say search(eval=\[eq(money(##),1)\])
  You say "#289 #325 #364 #368 #369"
  > say search(player=wizard)
  You say "#1"

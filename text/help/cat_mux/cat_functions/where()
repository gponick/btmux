 
& where()
 
  Syntax: where(<object>)
 
  This function returns the "true" location of an object. You must
  control the object or be near it in order for it to work. For
  players and things, the "true" location is the normal location of
  the object.
 
  For exits, the "true" location is the source room. For rooms, it is
  #-1.

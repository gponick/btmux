 
& sort()
 
  Syntax: sort(<list>[, <sort type>[, <delim>]])
 
  Takes a list of words, numbers, or dbref, and sorts them into
  ascending order. Lexicographic order is used for words, and numeric
  order is used for numbers and dbrefs.
 
  <sort type> may be used to specify the type of sort to perform (use
  d for dbref, n for integer numeric, f for floating numeric, and a
  for alphanumeric). If omitted or left blank, the function will
  automatically determine the type of sort to perform.
 
  If <delim> is specified, it (rather than a space) is used to
  separate items in the list. You may specify an alternate delimiter
  without specifying a sort type by passing a null <sort type>
  parameter.
 
  Example:
  > say sort(This is a test)
  You say "This a is test"
  > say sort(98 99 100 101)
  You say "98 99 100 102"
  > say sort(foo-bar-bletch,,-)
  You say "bar-bletch-foo"

 
& ulocal()2 
  Example:
 
&FRUIT me=apples bananas oranges pears
&SUB-FUNCTION me=[setq(0,v(FRUIT))][extract(%q0,match(%q0,%0),1)]
&TOP-FUNCTION me=[setq(0,are delicious!)][ulocal(SUB-FUNCTION,%0)]%q0
say u(TOP-FUNCTION,b*)
You say "bananas are delicious!"
 
If SUB-FUNCTION had been called with u() instead of ulocal():
 
&TOP-FUNCTION me=[setq(0,are delicious!)][u(SUB-FUNCTION,%0)] %q0
say u(TOP-FUNCTION,b*)
You say "bananas apples bananas oranges pears"
 
In this second example, in SUB-FUNCTION, %q0 was set to "apples
bananas oranges pears", so that when the u() "returned" and TOP-
FUNCTION evaluated %q0, this is what was printed. In the first
example, ulocal() reset the value of %q0 to its original "are
delicious!"

 
& hasattr()
 
  Syntax: hasattr(<object>, <attribute name>)
 
  Returns 1 if the object has the named attribute, and 0 if it does
  not. If the object does not exist or the player does not have the
  ability to examine the object, #-1 will be returned.
 
  This function doesn't check for attributes inherited from parent
  objects, but hasattrp() does.

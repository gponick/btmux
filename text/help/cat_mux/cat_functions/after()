 
& after()
 
  Syntax: after(<string1>, <string2>)
 
  This function returns the portion of <string1> that occurs after <
  string2>. If <string2> does not occur in <string1>, a null string is
  returned.
 
  If you want to return the portion of the string after the first
  space, use the rest() function instead.
 
  Example:
 
  > say after(This is a test,a)
  You say " test"
  > say after(This is a test,is)
  You say " is a test"
  > say after(This is a test, nope)
  You say ""

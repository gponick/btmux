 
& v()
 
  Syntax: v(<string>)
 
  This function can be used as an alternative for percent (%)
  substitution and also as a replacement for get(me/<arg>). If the
  argument is two characters long or longer and starts with a letter,
  then the object performing the v() call (and its parent, if
  necessary) is searched for the named attribute, and its value is
  returned if possible. Otherwise, a percent substitution is performed
  on the argument (so that v(o) is equivalent to %o, for instance).
 
  The percent form (%o in the previous example) is preferred as it is
  faster.
  
  Note: Attributes with single-character names cannot be retrieved
  with v().

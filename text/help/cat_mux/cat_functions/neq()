 
& neq()
 
  Syntax: neq(<integer1>,<integer2>)
 
  Takes two integers, and returns 1 if they are not equal and 0 if
  they are equal.
 
  Warning: Passing anything but integers will produce unexpected
  results, as non-numeric strings usually are treated as numeric 0.
 
  Example:
 
  > say neq(1,-1)
  You say "1"
  > say neq(5,5)
  You say "0"
  > say neq(foo, bar)
  You say "0"

  RS Command: report [<UnitID>|<x> <y>]
  
  This command provides the same information provided by the 
  'scan <object> i' command.
  
  The report command can operate over greater distances than the scan 
  command, however there is a corresponding decrease in accuracy of 
  the information provided for objects which are more distant.

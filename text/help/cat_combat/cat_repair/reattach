 
& reattach
 
  RS Command: reattach <loc>
  
  This command attaches a new limb to replace a head, leg or arm which 
  has  been destroyed. 
  
  A reattachment replaces the limb but does not install components, 
  weapons or armor on the limb. These repairs must be carried out once 
  the limb reattachment is complete.

  This mode indicates additional data about signals which are 
  relayed to you.
  
  Example:
  Given that you are out of radio range of UnitID [TT] but that UnitID 
  [BL] is within range of both units and has Relay enabled.
 
  [A:140] {R-path:[BL]-h:179} <MechJock> Can you guys hear me?
  
  * [A:140] indicates the bearing to UnitID [BL] from your unit.
  * (R-path:[BL]-  h:179) indicates that [BL] is relaying the 
    transmission to you and that the originating unit is at a bearing 
    of 179 degrees from UnitID [BL]

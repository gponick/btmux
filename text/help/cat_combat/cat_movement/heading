  RS Command: heading [<degrees>]
  
  If an argument is specified this command determines the direction 
  that an RS Unit will face.
  
  Without an argument the command returns the current heading of the 
  unit.
  
  The heading of the unit will not change immediately, as it takes 
  time for the unit to turn to another direction
  
  Example:
  Given that your unit's current heading is 120
 
  >heading 0
  Your current heading is 106.
  >heading
  Your current heading is 66.
  >heading
  Your current heading is 12.
  >heading
  Your current heading is 0.

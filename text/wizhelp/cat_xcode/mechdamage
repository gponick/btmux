  xcodevalue: mechdamage <>
  XTYPE: MECH
  
  This xcode value stores a list detailing damage to the RS Unit.
  
  The list is formated: 
  A:LOC/num[,LOC/num[,LOC(R),num]],I:LOC/num,C:LOC/num,R:LOC/num(num),G:LOC/num(num)

  NOTE - critical slots in this list are counted from ZERO, unlike 
  the critstatus command which counts from 1. Therefore the first 
  critslot is 0, the second is 1, and so on.
 
  Note - Special items such as searchlights are not displayed by this 
  list.

  * A: refers to armor damage. Therefore A:2/20 indicates that 
    location 2 has suffered 20 points of armor damage
 
  * A(R): refers to armor damage to the rear of the section. Therefore 
    A(R):2/1 indicates that location 2 has suffered 1 point of damage 
    to it's rear armor.
    
  * I: refers to internal damage. Therefore I:2/5 indicates that 
    location 2 has suffered 5 points of internal damage.
 
  * C: refers to critical damage. Therefore C:2/1 indicates that the 
    second critcal has been destroyed in location 2
 
  * R: refers to ammununition. Therefore R:4/9(5) indicates that the 
    ammunition biN in the 10th critslot of location 4 has has expended 
    5 'firings' worth of ammo
  
  * G: refers to temporary damage. Therefore G:1/4(6) indicates that 
    the object starting at the fifth critical in location 1 has a 
    failure. The failure being 6 it is an ammojam.

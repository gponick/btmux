& fork_dump

  Config parameter: fork_dump <yes/no>
  Default: yes

  Indicates whether or not database dumps are to be done by fork()ing
  off a separate process to perform the dump.  While enabling this
  parameter reduces the amount of time needed to perform the dump,
  it requires that the system  have enough free swap space to hold a
  second copy of the running game.

& earn_limit

  Config parameter: earn_limit <amount>
  Default: 10000

  Specifies the threshold at which earning additional money becomes
  difficult. Specifically, players with more than this much money no
  longer receive a  paycheck for each day they connect, don't receive
  insurance payments for being killed, and don't find money lying in
  the streets.

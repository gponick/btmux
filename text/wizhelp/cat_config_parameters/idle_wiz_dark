& idle_wiz_dark

  Config parameter: idle_wiz_dark <yes/no>
  Default: no

  Indicates whether or not wizards or players with the idle power who
  are idle for longer than the default timeout value are to
  automatically be set DARK, and then unDARKed when they type in
  their next command.

  Wizards  already set DARK are not automatically unDARKed. Any
  player who is set dark by this action will have a 'd' instead of a
  'D' by their idle time in the privileged WHO listing.

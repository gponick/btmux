& kill_max_cost

  Config parameter: kill_max_cost <amount>
  Default: 100

  Specifies the maximum amount of money that may be usefully spent on
  a kill attempt.  Spending more than this amount does not improve
  the chance of success.  Setting this parameter to less than the
  kill_guarantee_cost parameter prevents 'automatic kills', as the
  kill will always have a chance of failing.

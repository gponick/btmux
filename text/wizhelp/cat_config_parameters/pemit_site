& permit_site

  Config parameter: permit_site <addr> <mask>

  Indicates that connections are to be accepted and registration is
  not to be enforced from sites whose address matches the specified
  address when ANDed with the mask.  This directive is typically
  used to enable connections from a few selected hosts or subnets
  that would otherwise be disallowed by a forbid_site directive.
  The default is all sites permitted, none forbidden.

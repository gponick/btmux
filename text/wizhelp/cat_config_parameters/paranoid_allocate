& paranoid_allocate

  Config parameter: paranoid_allocate <yes/no>
  Default: no

  Controls whether or not the game performs a consistency check on the
  entire set of xbuf buffers each time one is allocated or freed.
  This check involves making sure that nobody has written to the
  memory immediately before and after each buffer.  Normally, only
  the buffer being allocated or freed is checked.

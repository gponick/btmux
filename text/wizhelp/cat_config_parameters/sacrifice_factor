& sacrifice_factor

  Config parameter: sacrifice_factor <amount>
  Default 5

  This parameter is part of the formula that is used to determine an
  object's value given the amount spent on its creation.  The
  formula is:

     value = (cost / sacrifice_factor) + sacrifice_adjust.

  The inverse formula is used to determine how much the owner receives
  when   @destroying an object.

& function_invocation_limit

  Config parameter: function_invocation_limit <num>
  Default: 2500

  This directive sets the maximum number of times that a command may
  make function calls.  If the invocation limit is exceeded, the
  string '#-1 FUNCTION INVOCATION LIMIT EXCEEDED' is returned.  This
  limit is  intended to prevent long hangs from creative uses of u()
  and iter().

  Note: @search is treated specially, each object examined with the
  eval=<arg> parameter is treated as a separate command for the
  purposes of the function invocation limit.

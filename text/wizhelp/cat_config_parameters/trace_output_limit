& trace_output_limit

  Config parameter: trace_output_limit <amount>
  Default: 200

  Specifies the maximum number of lines of trace output that will be
  displayed when using top-down format.  Bottom-up format output is
  not affected by this parameter.

  Note that this parameter is intended as a limit on the amount of
  memory used to store intermediate data and not on the quantity of
  trace output, top-down format needs to keep all intermediate
  results in memory before displaying them, while bottom-up format
  displays them immediately after generating them.

  When trace output lines are discarded, only the last
  (trace_output_limit) lines are kept.  These lines contain
  information about the evaluations done earliest in the process of
  evaluating the expression (usually the innermost evaluations and
  earlier arguments of outer functions).

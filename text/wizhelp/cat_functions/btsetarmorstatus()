 
& btsetarmorstatus()
 
  Syntax: btsetarmorstatus(<UnitDB>,<location>,<armortype>,<amount>)
 
  This function sets the armor on <UnitDB>'s <location> to <amount>.
  <armortype> determines which armor for the specified location is
  set:
    * 0 - Front armor
    * 1 - Internal armor
    * 2 - Rear armor (where applicable)
 
  This function permits <amounts> in excess of the templated value
  
  Note: Esnure that <amount> is numeric. Using a non-numeric argument
        will result in the armor value being set to 0

        the template for a unit

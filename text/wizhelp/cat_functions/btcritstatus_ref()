 
& btcritstatus_ref()
 
  Syntax: btcritstatus_ref(<UnitRef>,<location>)
 
  This function returns a string displaying the status of the
  criticals in <location> on a reference unit ie the default
  templated value.
 
  The string returned is formatted
 <critslot>|<?>|<partname>|<operational>|<crittype>
 
  Note: As this is a reference function, the return string will show
  no damage unless the unit was actually templated with damage.
 
  Note: The element denoted <?> is used for the brand of partnames,
  however brands are not implemented on this codebase, so will return
  empty
 
  <operational> returns 0 if the <critslot> is functional, -1 if the
  part at <critslot> is destroyed

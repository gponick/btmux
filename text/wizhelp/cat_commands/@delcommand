 
& @delcommand
 
  Syntax: @delcommand <name>[=<thing>/<attribute>]
  
  This command deletes a command which has been added to the MUX's 
  built-in command table using the @addcommand command.
  
  Arguments:
  * name - deletes all commands under <name>
  * 
  
   . When you specify 
  <thing> and <attribute>, it only deletes that specific entry. If the 
  command or commands you are deleting had replaced a built-in 
  command, the built-in command and all
  aliases are restored to their normal names and actions.

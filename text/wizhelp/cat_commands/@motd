  Syntax: @motd[/<switches>] <message>
 
  This command sets or lists short messages that are displayed to 
  players after they successfully log in to the game (or after they 
  fail because logins are not allowed).  These messages are displayed 
  in addition to the contents of the motd.txt and wizmotd.txt files.
 
  The following switches are available:
     (No switches)   - Sets the message that all players see when they connect.
     /wizard         - Sets the message that wizards see when they connect.
     /down           - Sets the message the players see when they try to
                       connect, but fail because logins are disabled.
     /full           - Sets the message that players see when they try to
                       connect, but fail because there are too many players
                       already connected.
     /list           - Lists the current messages.

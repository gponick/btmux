 
& @dump
 
  Syntax: @dump[/<switches>]
  
  Writes a checkpoint dump of the database to disk.  Checkpoint dumps 
  are automatically performed periodically, so there is usually no 
  need to use this command.  
  
  Switches may be used to either dump 
  just the structure portion of the database to a flat file, or to 
  ensure that all changes to the text database are written out to 
  disk.  The default is to write out both files.
  
  The following options are available:
     structure  - Dump the structure portion of the database to a flat 
                  file.
     text       - Ensure that all changes to the text portion of the
                  database are written out to disk.
     optimize   - Rewrites the gdbm hash table out to disk, compressing
                  unused space. Should be used sparingly, and only when
                  there has been a lot of shuffling in the database.
 
  Note that the structure and text options will cause your database and
  certain caches to be out of sync. They should NOT be used in the course
  of normal operation.

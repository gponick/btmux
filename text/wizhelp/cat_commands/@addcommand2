   Example:

  > &LOOK me=$look:say I looked here!
  > &LOOK_WITH_ARG me=$look *:say I looked at %0!
  > &LOOK_OUTSIDE me=$look/outside *:say I looked outside at %0!
  > @addcommand look=me/look
  > @addcommand look=me/look_with_arg
  > @addcommand look=me/look_outside
 
  As shown above more than one attribute can be specified with <name>. 
  When you type 'look' or 'look sofa', the game will execute all 
  attributes that match what you have typed. Aliases such as 'l' are 
  expanded to 'look' eliminating the need to deal with such when 
  taking command matching into consideration. If none of the 
  attributes attached match (the attribute *must* begin with $<name> 
  in order to match at all!), no output will be generated.
 
  Another use is to speed up use of a particular global command. 
  Commands in the built-in table are accessed much more quickly 
  than otherwise.

 
& @timewarp
 
  Syntax: @timewarp[/<switches>] <secs>
  
  This command subtracts (or adds if negative) <secs> to one or more 
  internal timers, depending on the switches specified from the 
  following list:
     /check    - The time left until the next consistency check and 
                 database cleaning.
     /dump     - The time left until the next automatic checkpoint 
                 dump.
     /idle     - The time left until the next check for idle users.
     /queue    - (default) Adjusts the time-to-execute for all entries 
                 in the wait and semaphore queues. Entries whose time-
                 to- execute becomes less than the  current time are 
                 then ready for execution. The contents of the object 
                 queue are also appended to the  player queue.
 
  Note: these flags may be specified together if desired.

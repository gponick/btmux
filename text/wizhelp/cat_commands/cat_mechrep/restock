 
& restock
 
  Mechrep Command: restock <loc> <critslot>
  
  This command reloads the ammobin in <loc> at <critslot>.
  Unlike the 'RELOAD' command, it does not alter the type
  of the ammo bin. Thus, it is useful for tech systems
  that simply want to reload an ammo bin without changing
  the template.
  
  Arguments:
  * name - the name of the weapon drawing on that ammobin
  * loc - the location of the ammobin (eg CT, LA)
  
  Example:
  
  >reload LA 10
  Weapon restocked!
  
  See Also: reload

 
& addmine
 
  Map Command: addmin <x> <y> <type> <strength> [option]
  
  This command adds a mine to the map.
  
  To run this command you must be within the mapobject to which the 
  map you wish to modify is attached.
  
  Arguments:
  * <x> <y> - the location of the mine
  * <type> - the type of mine to be placed on the map
    Valid types are:
    * standard - This mine will explode when an RS Unit enters the hex
    * inferno - As per standard, but adds heat instead of damage
    * vibra - This mine is is triggered by the weight of RS Units. The 
              [option] argument provides the required weight to 
              trigger the  mine. 
         Vibra detonation calculations:
         * RS Unit tonnage < required weight = no detonation
         * RS Unit tonnage => required weight = detonation when 
           entering hex (except where the next calculation applies)
         * RS Unit tonnage * n => required weight = detonation where n 
           is the number of hexes distant from the target hex
    * CD - Command detonated. This mine will only explode when it 
           recieves a transmission on the assigned frequency. The 
           [option] argument provides the freq.
    * trigger - this mine reports on the MineTriggers channel that a 
                unit has moved into the target hex.
    * scentrigger - as per trigger but currently not fully 
                    implemented.
  * <strength> - the number of points of damage the mine will do upon 
                 detonation.
    
  Examples:
  
  This command adds a strength 1 Command detonated mine to 10,10 which 
  will detonate when it receives a transmission on freq 123
  >addmine 10 10 cd 1 123
  
  This command adds a strength 3 standard mine to 4,6 
  > addmine 4 6 standard 3
  
  This command adds a strength 10 vibra mine to 1,1 which will 
  detonate at a weight of 20 tons or more
  > addmine 1 1 vibra 10 20
  Note - a 55 ton RS Unit will trigger this mine from over 3 hexes 
  away.

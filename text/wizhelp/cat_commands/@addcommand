 
& @addcommand
 
  Syntax: @addcommand <name>=<thing>/<attribute>
  
  This command has permits the addition of softcoded commands to the 
  MUX's built-in command table. 
  
  NOTE - if the specified name already exists as a hardcoded command 
  then the new command being added will replace the functionality of 
  the original.
  
  Example: 
  In the case of using @addcommand to add a command 'look' - this 
  command will replace the hardcoded look and all aliases that 
  currently point to it ie: the aliases 'l', 'lo', and 'loo', 
  and the main command 'look' will all point to the softcoded 
  command specified by the @addcommand. 
  
  The syntax of <thing>/<attribute> is like any normal $command.

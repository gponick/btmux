 
& --enable-sql-support

  Compile option: --enable-sql-support
  Default: disabled
 
  Enables the MUX->SQL port. This functions in the form of starting
  sqlslave processes alongside the main netmux to handle SQL queries
  via @query. This is great if you want to integrate your game and
  website together for things like player rankings. If you enable
  this, you will need libdbi and one or more of the libdbi database
  drivers installed.

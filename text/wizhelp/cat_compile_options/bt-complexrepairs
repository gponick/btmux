 
& bt-complexrepairs

  Compile option: --enable-bt-complexrepairs
  Default: disabled
 
  Enables per-tonnage parts for units. For example, you'd need a
  gyro built specifically for a 85 ton mech to replace an 85 ton
  mech's gyro. This is the case for most of the parts with this
  config directive enabled. You may need to rebuild your hcode.db
  file after enabling/disabling this.

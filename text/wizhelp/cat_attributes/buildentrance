& buildentrance

  Attribute: buildentrance [x,y] [x,y] [x,y] [x,y]

  This attribute is set on an object holding a sub-map and details
  the coordinates on that map that a unit will be placed at when
  entering.

  The attribute is a space delimited list of the coordinates in the
  order north, east, south, west

  Example:
  Given that #87 is a 10x10 hangar with entrances at the north (5,0),
  east (9,5), south (5,9) and west (0,5).

  >ex #87/buildentrance
  Buildentrance: 5,0 9,5 5,9 0,5
 
  A unit issuing the 'enterbase n' command would arrive on the hangar
  map at 5,0

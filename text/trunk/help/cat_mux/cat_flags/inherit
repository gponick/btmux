 
& INHERIT
 
  Flag: INHERIT (I)
 
  Previously, Wizard-owned objects had wizard powers.  This was
  a problem in many cases, so that behavior has changed.  Now, only
  Wizard objects or Wizard-owned Inherit-set objects have wizard 
  powers.
 
  Only players can set the Inherit flag, and the Inherit flag is 
  reset during @chown.  If a player is set Inherit, all his stuff is 
  assumed to be inherit, so his objects can control him.  If a 
  player is NOT Inherit, his stuff does NOT control him.  (i.e. 
  cannot @force him.)  This flag is not especially useful for non-
  wizards.

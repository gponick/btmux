 
& AUDIBLE
 
  Flag: AUDIBLE (a)
 
  When set on an object, player, or room, everything from a say, pose,
  or emit inside the object will be sent to every object in the 
  location of that object (except for rooms which have no location) 
  as well as to all objects mentioned in the object's Forwardlist 
  attribute.  When set on an exit, everything from a say, pose, or 
  emit in the room the exit is in will be forwarded to the room the 
  exit points to.  In both cases the @prefix attribute will be 
  inserted in front of the text, or a default prefix if no @prefix 
  attribute is set.  If the @filter attribute is present, it
  will be used to suppress those messages matching any of the 
  patterns specified.

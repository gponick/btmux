 
& SAFE
 
  Flag: SAFE (s)
 
  When set, requires the use of the /override switch to @destroy in
  order to destroy the object.  It does not prevent the destruction 
  of the object, but merely requires some additional effort.  If a 
  thing is set DESTROY_OK, its SAFE flag is ignored and it may be 
  destroyed without using the /override switch.

 
& CHOWN_OK
 
  Flag: CHOWN_OK (C)
 
  This flag, when set, allows you to transfer ownership to
  another player. To set it, you must be carrying the object. You
  also have to be in the room if you want to set this flag on rooms
  or exits.  After this flag is set, the new player may gain
  ownership of the object by using the @chown command.

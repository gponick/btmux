 
& NOBLEED
 
  Flag: NOBLEED (-)
 
  When set on a player, it will append an ANSI white character to
  the normal ANSI 'normal' character, so it will fix ANSI color
  'bleed' on most terminals. (Bleed occurs when a color extends into 
  text it was not meant to.) Do not set this flag unless you have 
  to, it tends to slow down the text display for the MUX.

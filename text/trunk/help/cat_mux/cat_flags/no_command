 
& no_command
 
  Flag: NO_COMMAND (n)
 
  The NO_COMMAND flag disables the checking of $-commands on an
  object.
 
  Most MUXes will be configured to automatically set this flag on
  rooms and players. The server runs faster when fewer objects are 
  checked for $-commands; thus, any object which does not have $-
  commands on it should be set NO_COMMAND.

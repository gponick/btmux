 
& TRACE
 
  Flag: TRACE(T)
 
  When a thing is set TRACE, it will report to its owner the result of
  all substitutions that it performs that change the original 
  string.  The order for displaying nested evaluations (such as when 
  evaluating the arguments to a function) is a site-selected 
  configuration parameter.
 
  When trace output is displayed in top-down order (final evaluation
  first, followed by the 'smaller' evaluations needed to perform 
  it), then the total  number of trace ouput lines that may be 
  produced by an evaluation is limited to 200.  Bottom-up trace 
  output is not limited.

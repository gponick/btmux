 
& MONITOR
 
  Flag: MONITOR(M)
 
  When set on an object, anytime the object hears something from
  someone who passes the object's use lock, the object's attributes 
  are scanned for attributes of the form '^<pattern>:<commandlist>'.  
  If the message matches the wildcarded <pattern>, then 
  <commandlist> is executed, substituting %0 for the text that 
  matched the first wildcard, %1 for the second, and so on.
  
  All matching attributes are executed, not just the first.
  Parents of MONITOR objects are never checked for ^-patterns.
 
  When set on a player, this flag notifies that player whenever
  someone connects or disconnects from the MUX. It is valid only for 
  players, and must be set by a wizard.

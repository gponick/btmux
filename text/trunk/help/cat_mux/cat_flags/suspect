  Flag: SUSPECT (u)
 
  The SUSPECT flag is a marker used to denote players that are to be
  watched. Any player with this flag set will have every command 
  they type sent to the SuspectsLog channel for monitoring. Players 
  can't see the flag set on themselves and don't know they are 
  suspected.

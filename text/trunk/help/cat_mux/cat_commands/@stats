 
& @stats
 
  Syntax: @stats[/all] [<player>]
 
  Display the number of objects in the game.  @stats/all gives a
  breakdown by object types.  If <player> is specified, the breakdown
  for the named player is given.  You may only list individual counts
  for yourself.  If invoked with no arguments or switches this command
  is free, but if you specify either /all or <player>, then this
  command costs 100 coins to run, because it is computationally
  expensive.

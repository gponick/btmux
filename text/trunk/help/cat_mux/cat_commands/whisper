& whisper

  Syntax: whisper <player>=<message>

  Whispers the message to the named person, if they are in the same
  room as you. No one else can see the message that you whisper.

  You can format the message one of several ways by specifying ':',
  ';', or '"' as the first character of the message.  ':' and ';'
  format the message as 'You sense <player> <message>', with ';'
  omitting the space between <player> and <message>.  '"' formats
  the message in normal whisper format (this is the default).

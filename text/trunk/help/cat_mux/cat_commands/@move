  Syntax: @move <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Move
 
  Sets the message that an object sees after it moves from one
  location to another, whether by using an exit, entering or leaving
  an object, teleporting, or going home.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players, and things and will never
  be automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Example: @move bopper = OK.  You're there now.

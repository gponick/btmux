 
& @leave
 
  Syntax: @leave <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Leave
 
  Sets the message that a player sees when leaving an object or room,
  whether by using an exit, the enter or leave commands, or by
  teleporting.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in leave
  messages, and are evaluated when someone leaves the object.  In
  function references, 'me' refers to the object being left, while %
  -substitutions that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc)
  refer to the player leaving the object.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players, things, and rooms, and
  will never be automatically triggered on exits.
 
  Example:
  @leave car = You unbuckle your seatbelt and climb out of the car.

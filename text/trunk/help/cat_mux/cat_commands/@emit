 
& @emit
 
  Syntax: @emit[/<switches>] <message>
 
  Sends <message> to everyone in your current location without
  prefixing it by your character name.  You can also send the
  message to everyone in the room that contains the object you are
  inside with the /room switch.
 
  The following switches are available:
  /here  - Sends the message to everyone in the same location as you.
  /room  - Sends the message to everyone in the room that contains the
           object you are in.  Starting from your location, this
           switch 'leaves' objects until it reaches a
           room, and @emits the message there.
 
  If both switches are specified, the message is sent to both places.
 
  If neither is specified, /here is assumed.
 
  Some MUXes may restrict the use of this command.

 
& @cost
 
  Syntax: @cost <object> = <amount>
  Attribute: Cost
 
  Sets the number of coins that need to be given to an object to
  trigger the Pay, Opay, and Apay attributes.  If the object is
  given more than this amount, the excess is returned to the giver,
  while if less than this amount is given the entire amount is
  returned, a snide message is sent to the giver, and the Apay,
  Opay, and Pay attributes are not used.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for things, and will never be
  automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Example:
  @cost Coke machine = 25

 
& @efail
 
  Syntax: @efail <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Efail
 
  Sets the message that a player sees when he tries to enter the
  object but fails because the object is not ENTER_OK or the player
  fails the object's enter lock.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in efail
  messages, and are evaluated when someone fails to enter the
  object.  In function references, 'me' refers to the object that
  the enactor tried to enter, while %-substitutions that refer to
  the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer to the the player who
  tried (and failed) to enter.
 
  The enter lock only affects the 'enter' command and its aliases (set
  via the @ealias command), it does not affect exits that lead to
  the object or teleporting in.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players and things, and will never
  be automatically triggered on rooms or exits.
 
  Example:
  @efail car = The car's door is locked.

 
& @femit
 
  Syntax: @femit[/<switches>] <object>=<message>
 
  Forces <object> to emit <message>.  This command is similar to the
  command '@force <object> = @emit <message>', except that it will
  work so long as you own the object, whereas @force may fail if the
  object has its INHERIT flag set and the object performing the
  @force does not.
 
  The following switches are available:
     /here  - Sends the message to everyone in the same location as
              <object>.
     /room  - Sends the message to everyone in the room that contains
              the object that <object> is in.  Starting from your
              location, this switch 'leaves' objects until it reaches
              a room, and @emits the message there.
 
  If both switches are specified, the message is sent to both places.
 
  If neither is specified, /here is assumed.
 
  Some MUXes may restrict the use of this command.

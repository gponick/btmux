 
& @robot
 
  Syntax: @robot <name>=<password>
 
  Creates a robot player owned by you.  The robot has its ROBOT flag
  set, so it may use the OUTPUTPREFIX and OUTPUTSUFFIX commands that
  most publicly available robot programs require.  This command
  costs 1000 coins.
 
  Note that some sites do not restrict OUTPUTSUFFIX and OUTPUTPREFIX
  to robots.

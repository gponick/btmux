 
& @alias
 
  Syntax: @alias <player> = <name>
  Attribute: Alias
 
  Provides an alternate name by which the player is known.  The
  alternate name is only used for players when referenced as
  '*<name>' or by commands that only take playernames (such as page
  or @stats).  You may not set an alias on any other object type.
 
  When setting an alias, the alias is checked to see that it is both a
  legal player name and not already in use.  Only if both checks
  succeed is the alias set.

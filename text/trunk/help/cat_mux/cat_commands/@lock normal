& @lock normal

  NORMAL LOCKS:

  Key: <object>

  You pass a normal lock if you either are the named object or if you
  carry the named object.  <object> may be the name or #number of a
  thing, a playername prefixed by an asterisk (*<playername>), 'me',
  or 'here'.

  Examples:
    > @lock treasure room = secret key
    > @lock private area = me
  See also: @lock is, @lock carry.

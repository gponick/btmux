 
& leave
 
  Syntax: leave[/<switch>]
 
  This command leave allows you to exit an object you have entered,
  arriving in the same location as the object. You may not leave an
  object if you fail that object's LeaveLock (but you may still
  @teleport out, use an exit inside the object, or go home).
 
  The following switch is recognized:
     /quiet   - Don't perform the @oleave/@aleave or @olfail/@alfail
                attributes on the entered object, and don't perform
                the @oxenter attribute on your new location.  This
                switch only works if you control your
                current location.

 
& &
 
  Command: &<attribute> <object>[=<value>]
  Synonym: @set <object> = <attribute>:[<value>]
 
  Sets the attribute named <attribute> on <object> to <value>.  If
  <attribute> is not a predefined attribute (like ofail or va), then
  it is created.  Attributes so created are called user-named
  attributes.

  Attribute names may only contain letters, numbers, and the
  characters < -_.@#$^&*~?=+| >, and must start with a letter.  The
  names of user-named attributes may not be abbreviated (an attempt
  to get the value of the attribute will fail, and an attempt to set
  will create a new attribute).

  The & command may be used to set predefined attributes (in this
  instance, '&<attr> <object>=<value>' is equivalent to '@<attr>
  <object>=<value>').

 
& @dfail
 
  Syntax: @dfail <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Dfail
 
  Sets the message that a player sees when he tries to drop the object
  but fails because he didn't pass the object's drop lock.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in drop failure
  messages, and are evaluated when someone drops the object.  In
  function references, 'me' refers to the object being dropped,
  while %-substitutions that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#,
  %p, etc) refer to the dropper.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for players and things, and will
  never be automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Example:
  @dfail sword = The sword has welded itself to your hand.

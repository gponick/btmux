 
& @orfail
 
  Syntax: @orfail <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Orfail
 
  Sets the message (prefixed by the player's name) that is shown to
  others in the same room when someone tries to give <object> a
  thing that does not pass <object>'s receive lock.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in receive
  failure messages, and are evaluated when someone tries to give
  away the object. In function references, 'me' refers to the
  intended recipient of the object, while %-substitutions that refer
  to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer to the (attempted)
  giver.
 
  Example:
  @orfail merchant = tries to unload some worthless trash on Astinous.

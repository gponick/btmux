 
& @tfail
 
  Syntax: @tfail <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Tfail
 
  Sets the message that a player sees when he tries to teleport to
  somewhere he does not have permission.  You do not see this
  message if you couldn't teleport out of your present location.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in teleport
  failure messages, and are evaluated when someone attempts to
  teleport to the specified destination.  In function references,
  'me' refers to the teleport destination, while %-substitutions
  that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer to the
  player attempting the teleport.
 
  When a player teleports another object (@tel <object> =
  <destination>), the lock is checked against the player, not the
  object.
 
  Example:
  @tfail here = A psychic barrier prevents you from teleporting there.

 
& drop
 
  Syntax: drop[/<switch>] <object>
           drop[/<switch>] <exit>
 
  The first form removes <object> from your inventory and puts it in
  your location, except for the following special cases: Dropping a
  STICKY thing sends it home, and dropping a thing in a room with a
  drop-to sends the thing to the drop-to location.
 
  The second form removes <exit> from your list of exits and adds it
  to the list of exits for the current location.  Anyone in the same
  location as you may then use the exit to travel to the exit's
  destination.  You can only drop exits when you own the location
  where you are dropping them.
 
  The following switch is recognized:
     /quiet   - Don't perform the @odrop/@adrop attributes on the
                dropped object.  This switch only works if you control
                the object.
 
  NOTE: 'throw' is the same as 'drop'.

 
& @listen
 
  Syntax: @listen <object> = <string>
  Attribute: Listen
 
  This attribute contains a wildcard pattern that the object listens
  for. Anything spoken, posed, emitted, or whispered in the room
  that <object> is in, as well as messages resulting from using
  objects (such as Opay and Succ messages) are checked against the
  Listen attribute.  When the object hears something that matches
  the pattern, it triggers the Ahear attribute, as well as either
  the Amhear or Aahear attributes, as appropriate, substituting %0
  the string that matched the first wildcard character in the
  Listen, %1 for the second. etc.  If the pattern in the Listen
  attribute is matched, objects in <object>'s inventory will also
  hear the message and have a chance to match it.  Objects whose
  Listen attribute is set to anything will be listed when a @sweep
  command is run by someone in the same room.
 
  If the @listen pattern is matched, then the object's contents will
  hear the message also, prefixed by the text in @inprefix if it is
  set.  Any  text that matches any pattern specified in @infilter
  will not be sent to the contents.
 
  Example:
      @listen camera = * has arrived.
      @ahear camera = @va me = %va %0

& @lock ownership

  OWNERSHIP LOCKS:

  Key: $<object>

  You pass an ownership lock if you have the same owner as <object>.

  Examples:
    > @lock mystuff=$me
    Only objects you own may use the mystuff exit.

    > @lock/page me = !$*TinyJerk
    Neither TinyJerk nor any of his objects may page you.

  See also: @lock normal.

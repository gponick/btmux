 
& @lfail
 
  Syntax: @lfail <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Lfail
 
  Sets the message that a player sees when he tries to leave it but
  fails because the player fails the object's leave lock.
 
  The leave lock only affects the 'leave' command and its aliases (set
  via the @ealias command), it does not affect going home, using an
  exit in the location, or teleporting out.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players and things, and will never
  be automatically triggered on rooms or exits.
 
  Example:
  @lfail plane = You don't have a parachute!

  Command: @malias
  
  This allows you to generate and maintain mailing lists with the mail
  system. All mail aliases start with '*', and are case-sensitive. (*dir is
  different than *Dir).  There are two kinds of mail aliases, Personnal
  and Global. Global mailing lists are owned and maintained by the god (#1)
  char and are available for anyone to use.  Generally there will be
  *Wizards, *Admin, *Roleplay, and things of that nature.  Personal mailing
  aliases are mailing lists that you have defined with the @malias commad.
  Currently there is no limit to the number of people you can have on a
  mailing alias.
 
  To begin sending mail to a mailing list, use @mail *<alias>=subject.
  
  Usage:
  
  @malias                   Displays a list of all mail aliases.
  @malias *<alias>          Displays a list of people on that alias.
  @malias *<alias>=<list>   Creates that mailing list, using <list>.

  sent to *Bugs, or Lauren.

& @malias2
 
  You can add, remove, rename, chown, redescribe, and delete mailing lists
  with a switch.
  
  @malias/remove *<alias>=<player>     Removes <player> from *<alias>.
  @malias/desc *<alias>=<description>  Changes the description for *<alias>. 
  @malias/add *<alias>=<player>        Adds <player> to *<alias>.
  @malias/rename *<alias>=<name>       Renames that alias. Names must always
                                       begin with '*'.
  @malias/delete <alias>               Deletes <alias>. This is the only
                                       alias command that does not require
                                       the '*' in front of the alias' name.
  @malias/chown *<alias>=<player>      Changes the owner of <alias> to
                                       <player>.
 
  Wizards can use all of the malias commands on any mail alias. Instead of
  trying to figure out different mailing lists with the same name, wizards
  may use #<MALIAS NUMBER> instead of *alias in regards to the command.
  Remember that the alias commands will only recognize aliases owned by #1,
  owned by you, or by number.
  
  @malias/list                         When invoked by a wizard, it will
                                       list all mailing aliases currently
                                       defined by their number.

 
& @edit
 
  Syntax: @edit <object>/<wild-attr> = <search>,<replace>
          @edit <object>/<wild-attr> = ^,<text>
          @edit <object>/<wild-attr> = $,<text>
 
  This command edits the contents of one or more attributes of an
  object, eliminating the need to retype a long attribute in order
  to make a simple change.  In the first form, all occurrences of
  <search> in the specified attribute of the named object are
  replaced with <replace>.  Use curly braces ({ and }) around
  <search> or <replace> if they contain commas.
 
  The second and third form prepend and append <text> to the selected
  attributes, respectively.
 
  If <wild-attr> contains wildcard characters, then all attributes
  that match are edited.

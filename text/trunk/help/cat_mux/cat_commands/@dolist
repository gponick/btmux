 
& @dolist
 
  Syntax: @dolist[/<switch>] [<delimiter>] <list>=<action>
 
  <list> is a list of strings, which can be object numbers,
  attributes, or arbitrary words.  <action> is a command to perform
  once for each item in <list>, replacing the special symbol ## with
  the corresponding item from <list>, and the symbol #@ with the
  position in the list, starting with one. By default, @dolist
  considers each item in <list> to be separated with spaces. If you
  specify the /delimit switch, then each item is considered to be
  separated by <delimiter>. <delimiter> must be a single character.
 
  If present, <switch> can be any of:
    /space   - (Default) List elements are separated by spaces.
    /delimit - List elements are separated by <delimiter>.
 
  This command is particularly handy with lcon() and lexits(). A few
  examples:
 
    @dolist [lcon(here)] = "[name(##)](##)
    @dolist [lcon(here)] = @switch [get(##/last)]=*1990*,"[name(##)]
    @va me = va vb vc
    @dolist [get(me/va)] = @emit [get(me/##)]
    @dolist Frodo Bilbo Gandalf = page ## = HELP!!!!  I've fallen into
    a pit.
    @dolist/delimit , {Frodo, Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf} = page ## =
    HELP!!!!

  @cpattr <obj>/<attr> = <obj1>/<attr1> [,<obj2>/<attr2>,
  <obj3>/<attr3>,...]
  @cpattr <obj>/<attr> = <obj1> [,<obj2>,<obj3>,...]
  @cpattr <attr> = <obj1>/<attr1> [,<obj2>/<attr2>,<obj3>/<attr3>,...]
  @cpattr <attr> = <obj1> [,<obj2>,<obj3>,...]
 
  The first form of this command is used to copy <attr> on <obj> to
  the object-attribute pairs in a comma-separated list. For example:
 
  @cpattr test/va = test/vb, cube/va, tribble/foo
 
  would copy the VA attribute from object "test" to VB on "test",
  VA on "cube", and FOO on "tribble".  <objN> is matched as if
  you were performing a @set on it.
 
  The second form copies <attr> to the list of objects, with the name
  <attr>. The third form copies <attr> from the object that executes
  the @cpattr, to the object-attribute pairs in the list. Finally,
  the third form copies <attr> from the object that executes the
  @cpattr to the objects in the list, with the name <attr>.

 
& @amail
 
  Syntax: @amail <player> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Amail
 
  Sets the actions to be taken after a player receives @mail. This
 should *never* @mail another player, as this could cause an
 infinite loop.
 
  Example:
  @amail me=@mail/file [mail()]=2
 
  This would place all incoming messages in folder #2.

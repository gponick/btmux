 
& @alfail
 
  Syntax: @alfail <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Alfail
 
  Sets the action to be taken by an object when someone tries to leave
  it but fails because the player fails the object's leave lock.
 
  The leave lock only affects the 'leave' command and its aliases (set
  via the @ealias command), it does not affect going home, using an
  exit in the location, or teleporting out.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players and things, and will never
  be automatically triggered on rooms or exits.
 
  Example:
  @alfail box = :rattles around as %n tries to escape.

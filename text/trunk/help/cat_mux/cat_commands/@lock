 
& @lock
 
  Syntax: @lock[/<whichlock>] <object>=<key>
           @lock <object>/<attrib>
 
  The first form locks <object> to a specific key(s).  Type 'help
  @lock keys' for a list of the keys you may use.
 
  <whichlock> indicates which lock you want to set on the object.
  If you don't specify one, you set the Default lock. Type 'help
  @lock locks' for a list of the locks you may set and what they are
  used for.
 
  The second form locks the indicated attribute of the named object,
  so that when the object is @chowned, the attribute will remain
  owned by you. It may also be used when you own an attribute on an
  object that you do not own, in this case it prevents the object's
  owner from @chowning the attribute to himself, and prevents anyone
  from modifying or removing the attribute.

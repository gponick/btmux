 
& @signature
 
  Syntax: @signature <player> = <message>
  Attribute: Signature
 
  Sets a message to be appended to ever @mail message you send. It is
  appended directly at the end of the message, so if you wish to start
  the signature on a new line you should begin it with a %r.
 
  Example: @signature me=%rThis is a mail signature. (Note: You might
  want to include the %r at the front of the signature, other wise
  it will be combined with the @mail message.)

 
& mail-admin
 
  The @mail command can also take the following switches:
 
    @mail/stats [<player>]    --  Basic mail statistics.
    @mail/dstats [<player>]   --  Also provides read/unread count.
    @mail/fstats [<player>]   --  Does all that, plus gives space
                                  usage.
 
    @mail/debug <action>[=<player>]
    @mail/nuke
 
  Only wizards may stats players other than themselves. The mail
  statistics  commands are computationally expensive, and thus are
  subject to "daytime"  restrictions. They also cost the same as a
  @find (100 credits).
 
  The /debug switch does sanity checking on the mail database, and may
  only be used by a wizard. "@mail/debug sanity" just does the
  check; the command "@mail/debug clear=<player name or dbref
  number>" wipes mail for an object.
  "@mail/debug fix" attempts to repair problems noted in the sanity
  check.
 
  The /nuke switch destroys the post office, erasing all @mail
  everywhere. It may only be used by a wizard.
 
  Also, admin may set the @amail attrib on their char.  When somebody
  sends you mail, it will trigger that attrib if it exists.

  @mail[/<switches>] <player-list> = <subject>
  @mail[/<switches>] [<msg-list> [= <target>]]
 
  @mail invokes the built-in MUX mailer, which allows players to send
  and receive mail. Pronoun/function substitution is performed on
  any messages you may try to send.
 
  A <player-list> is a space-separated list of recipients, which may
  be:
        Player names (names with spaces in them should be put in
        double quotes, ex: "Foo Bar")
        Player dbref #'s
	
	Message numbers to be replied to.
	A mix of the above, and mail aliases (see @malias)
 
  A <msg-list> is one of the following:
        A single msg # (ex: 3)
        A message range (ex: 2-5, -7, 3-)
        A sender (ex: *lauren)
        An age of mail in days (ex: ~3 (exactly 3), <2, >1)
        "days" here means 24-hour periods from the current time.
        One of the following: "read", "unread", "cleared", "tagged",
        "urgent"
        For certain commands, "all".

  EVALUATION LOCKS:
 
  Key: <attribute>/<value>
 
  Evaluation locks let you evaluate one of your attributes and compare
  the result against a value stored in the lock.  The result must be
  an exact match (no wildcarding allowed, but uppercase and lowercase
  are considered to be the same).  When evaluating the attribute the
  enactor substitutions (%#/%n/etc) are replaced with information
  about the player trying to pass the lock, and 'me' and %! refer to
  the locked object or exit.
 
  If you call an indirect lock and the indirect lock is an evaluation
  lock (or is a compound lock that includes an evaluation lock),
  then the original lock object is checked for the attribute first,
  followed by the object that has the actual evaluation lock.  If
  there are multiple levels of indirection the intermediate locks
  are not checked.

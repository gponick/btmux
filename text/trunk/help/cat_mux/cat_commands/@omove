 
& @omove
 
  Syntax: @omove <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Move
 
  Sets the message that others in the same location see after the
  object has moved to that location from somewhere else, whether by
  using an exit, entering or leaving an object, teleporting, or
  going home.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players, and things and will never
  be automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Example:
  @omove car = coasts to a stop.

 
& @aconnect
 
  Syntax: @aconnect <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Aconnect
 
  Sets the actions to be taken by a player right after connecting to
  the game.  This attribute is only meaningful for players, and will
  never be automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  It is also possible to check the zone object/objects in the zone
  parent room for an @aconnect. If one is found, it will be executed
  when a player connects in that zone.
 
  Example: @aconnect me = check.my.mailbox
 
  See also: @adisconnect.

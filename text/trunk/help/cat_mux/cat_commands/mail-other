  @mail/clear [<msg-list | all>]
  @mail/unclear [<msg-list> | all>]
        These commands mark mail in the current folder as cleared or
        uncleared.
        Mail marked for clearing is deleted when you disconnect, or
        if you use @mail/purge. If no msg-list is specified, all
        mail in your current folder is cleared. If "all" is given
        instead of a msg-list, all mail in *all* folders is
        cleared/uncleared.
 
  @mail/purge
        Actually deletes all messages marked for clearing with
  @mail/clear.
        This is done automatically when you log out.
 
  @mail/tag [<msg-list | all>]
  @mail/untag [<msg-list> | all>]
        These commands tag or untag mail in the current folder.
        Tagged mail can be later acted on en masse by using "tagged"
        as the msg-list for other commands (which does *not*
        untag them afterward). If no msg-list is specified,
        all messages in the current folder are tagged/untagged. If
        "all" is given as the msg-list, all mail in *all*
        folders is tagged/untagged.
   
  Example:
  To clear all mail from Lauren and Crusade:
  @mail/tag *lauren,
  @mail/tag *crusade
  @mail/clear tagged
  @mail/untag all
 
{ 'help mail-other2' for more }

  You can add, remove, rename, chown, redescribe, and delete mailing
  lists with a switch.
 
  @malias/remove *<alias>=<player>     Removes <player> from *<alias>.
  @malias/desc *<alias>=<description>  Changes the description for
                                       *<alias>.
  @malias/add *<alias>=<player>        Adds <player> to *<alias>.
  @malias/rename *<alias>=<name>       Renames that alias. Names must
                                       always begin with '*'.
  @malias/delete <alias>               Deletes <alias>. This is the
                                       only alias command that does
                                       not require the '*' in front of
                                       the alias' name.
  @malias/chown *<alias>=<player>      Changes the owner of <alias> to
                                       <player>.
 
  Wizards can use all of the malias commands on any mail alias.
  Instead of trying to figure out different mailing lists with the
  same name, wizards may use #<MALIAS NUMBER> instead of *alias in
  regards to the command.
 
  Remember that the alias commands will only recognize aliases owned
  by #1, owned by you, or by number.
 
  @malias/list                         When invoked by a wizard, it
                                       will list all mailing aliases
                                       currently defined by their
                                       number.

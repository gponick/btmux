  CARRY LOCKS:
 
  Key: +<object>
 
  You pass a carry lock if you are carrying the named object.
 
  Example:
    > @lock secret passage = +magic bus
    You can only traverse the secret passage if you are carrying the
    magic bus.  The bus cannot enter the passage on its own (perhaps
    when you are driving it).

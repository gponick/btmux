  Syntax: @aufail <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Aufail
 
  Sets the list of commands to be run when someone 'use's the object
  but fails the object's use lock.  Note that the other functions
  controlled  by the use lock (paying, listening, and $-commands) do
  not trigger Aufail.
 
  Example:
  @aufail robot = "I _told_ you to leave me alone; kill %n=100

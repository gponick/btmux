 
& @decompile
 
  Syntax: @decompile[/dbref] <thing>[/attr] [=<newname>]
 
  Dumps the sequence of commands you would have to type to clone
  <thing>. This is handy for saving your objects in a text file in
  case the MUX dies a horrible death, or for moving your pride-and-
  joy creation from one MUX to another.  @decompile works on all
  object types.
 
  If you specify <newname>, then the commands emitted will set
  attributes, locks, and flags on an object named <newname> and will
  omit the command to create the object.
  If you specify <thing>/<attr>, <attr> accepts wildcards.
  If you specify the /dbref switch, you will get output using the
  dbref number instead of the object name.

 
& @wipe
 
  Syntax: @wipe <object>[/<wild-attr>]
 
  This command erases attributes from an object.  All attributes that
  match <wild-attr> (or all attributes, if <wild-attr> is not
  specified) are removed from <object>.  Attributes that you do not
  have permission to modify (such as read-only or locked attributes)
  are not removed.

 
& @mvattr
 
  Syntax: @mvattr <object>=<old>,<new>[,<copy1>]...
 
  This command moves attributes around on an object.  The attribute
  <old> is renamed <new> (and is copied to <copy1>, <copy2> and so
  on if specified).
 
  If you cannot modify the <old> attribute (for instance if you are
  trying to move the Last attribute, or if it were owned by another
  player), then a new copy is made and the original is not removed.

 
& take
 
  Syntax: take[/<switch>] <object>
           take[/<switch>] <exit>
           take[/<switch>] <object>'s <sub-object>
 
  The first form picks up <object> from your location and adds it to
  your inventory.  It will fail if the object is locked against you,
  or if you are inside a player or object that you don't control and
  which isn't set ENTER_OK.
 
  The second form takes an exit from your location and adds it to you.
  Anyone inside you may then use the exit to travel to the exit's
  destination.
 
  You may take exits that you own, and exits owned by others in
  locations that you own.
 
  The third form takes <sub-object> from <object> and adds it to your
  inventory.  <object> must be ENTER_OK and <sub-object> must not be
  locked against you for this to work.  The lock on <object> is not
  checked.

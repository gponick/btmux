 
& think
 
  Syntax: think <message>
 
  You can use this command to send a private message to yourself.
  Pronoun substitution is performed. This is essentially equivalent
  to "@pemit me=<message>", but with "think", there is no prepended
  text.
 
  One possible use: "@adesc me=think --> %n(%#[flags(%#)])
  just looked at you."

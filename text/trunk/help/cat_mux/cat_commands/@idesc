 
& @idesc
 
  Syntax: @idesc <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Idesc
 
  Sets the internal description for <object>.  The internal
  description of an bject will be shown to any player entering it.
  If not set, the regular description in the Desc attribute is shown
  instead.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in inside
  descriptions, and are evaluated when someone fails to get or look
  at the object.
 
  In function references, 'me' refers to the object being looked at,
  while %-substitutions that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#,
  %p, etc) refer to the player doing the looking.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for players and things, and will
  never be automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Example:
  @idesc car = You are sitting in the driver's seat of a Volkswagen
  Beetle.

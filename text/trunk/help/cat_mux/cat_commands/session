 
& SESSION
 
  Syntax: SESSION
 
  Displays information on how many characters you have sent and
  received during this session, and which (Internal) port you are
  connected to on the MUX.  It must be typed in all uppercase.
 
  Example:
    > SESSION
                           Characters Input----  Characters Output---
  Player Name   On For Idle Port Pend  Lost   Total  Pend  Lost Total
  Mortal        00:06   0s   16    0     0       44   156     0 2679
  2 Players logged in.
 
  Pending characters are those waiting to be acted on as commands (for
  input) or waiting to be sent out over the network (output).  Lost
  characters are due to overflowing either the MUX's input or output
  buffers, either as the  result of running a single command that
  produces too much output (such as @find and @search commands that
  match a large number of objects), or from typing too much on one
  line.
 
  Note: your Pending count for output will always be nonzero, as the
  output of the SESSION command hasn't been sent out over the
  network yet.

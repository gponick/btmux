 
& @force
 
  Syntax: @force <player/object>=<command>
 
  Forces the game to act as though <player/object> had entered
  <command>.
 
  You may only force objects that you control.  Objects may not force
  players unless either the object or the player has their INHERIT
  flag set, and objects that do not have their INHERIT flag set may
  not force objects that do.  If the victim is specified by number,
  you may use an alternate form of the command, '#<number> <command>'.

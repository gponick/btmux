 
& @chzone
 
  Syntax: @chzone <object>=<zone object>.
 
  Changes the zone of <object> to <zone object>. If <zone object> is
  "none", the zone is reset to NOTHING.
 
  @chzone'ing a player does not automatically change the zone of their
  objects. Anyone may reset the zone of an object they own; <zone
  object> must either be "none", or must be owned by them. Only
  wizards may @chzone an object to an arbitrary zone object. Players
  may @chzone themselves to an object they own; otherwise, only
  wizards may @chzone players.
 
  @chzone'ing resets the WIZARD, ROYALTY, and INHERIT flags on
  non-player objects.

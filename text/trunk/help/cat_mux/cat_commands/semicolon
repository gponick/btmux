 
& ;
 
  Syntax: ;<message>
 
  This command is much like the ':' command, except that no space is
  inserted between your name and the action.
 
  Example:
  ;'s watch beeps.
 
  produces '<yourname>'s watch beeps.'.
 
  Warning: This command does not work in command lists run from an
  attribute because the ';' is treated as the command separator.
  Use pose/nospace  instead.

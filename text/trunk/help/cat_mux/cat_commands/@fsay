  Syntax: @fsay <object>=<message>
 
  Forces <object> to say <message>.  This command is similar to the command
  '@force <object> = say <message>', except that it will work so long as you
  own the object, whereas @force may fail if the object has its INHERIT flag
  set and the object performing the @force does not.
 
  See Also: @femit, @fpose, INHERIT, say.

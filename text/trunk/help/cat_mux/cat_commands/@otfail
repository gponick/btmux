 
& @otfail
 
  Syntax: @otfail <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Otfail
 
  Sets the message (prefixed by the player's name) that is shown to
  others in the same room when someone tries to teleport to
  somewhere he does not have permission.  You do not see this
  message if they couldn't teleport out of their present location.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in teleport
  failure messages, and are evaluated when someone attempts to
  teleport to the specified destination.  In function references,
  'me' refers to the teleport destination, while %-substitutions
  that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer to the
  player attempting the teleport.
 
  When a player teleports another object (@tel <object> =
  <destination>), the lock is checked against the player, not the
  object.
 
  Example:
  @otfail here = thinks about teleporting to the Magic Room,
  but decides against it at the last moment.

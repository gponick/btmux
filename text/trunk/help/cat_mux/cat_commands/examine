 
& examine
 
  Syntax: examine[/<switches>] <object>[/<wild-attrib>]
 
  Displays all available information about <object>.  <object> may be
  an object, 'me' or 'here'. You must control the object to examine
  it, or it  must be set VISUAL.  If you do not own the object, you
  will just see the name of the object's owner, and optionally any
  public attributes and attributes owned by you set on the object.
 
  If an attribute is owned by a player other than the owner of the
  object, the number of the attribute owner is shown in parentheses
  immediately following the attribute name.  Flag letters may appear
  in parentheses also, to indicate the status of the attribute:
    + - The attribute is locked, it does not change ownership when the
        object is @chowned and may not be modified.
    $ - The attribute is not checked when looking for $-commands.
        Note that the predefined attributes DESC, IDESC, ODESC,
        FAIL, OFAIL,  SUCC, OSUCC, DROP, ODROP, SEX, and CHARGES are
        never checked.
    I - This attribute is not inherited by children of the object.
    V - The attribute is visible to anyone who examines you.  Note
        that the predefined attributes DESC, SEX, and LAST are
        always VISUAL.

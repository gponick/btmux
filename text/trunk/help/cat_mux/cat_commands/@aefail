 
& @aefail
 
  Syntax: @aefail <object> = <command-list>
  Attribute: Aefail
 
  Sets the action to be taken by an object when someone tries to enter
  it but fails because the object is not ENTER_OK or the player
  fails the object's enter lock.
 
  The enter lock only affects the 'enter' command and its aliases (set
  via the @ealias command), it does not affect exits that lead to
  the object or teleporting in.
 
  This attribute is meaningful for players and things, and will never
  be automatically triggered on rooms or exits.
 
  Example:
  @aefail car = @emit ;'s alarm starts wailing when %n tries
  to break in.

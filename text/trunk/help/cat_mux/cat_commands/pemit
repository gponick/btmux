 
& @pemit
 
  Syntax: @pemit[/switches] <what>=<message>
 
  Emits <message> only to <what>, or to <what>'s contents of the
  /contents switch is given.  <what> must be either in the same
  location as you or be something you own.  You can also @pemit to
  distant players if pagelocks allow you to page them, and this
  costs as much as a page <This feature is not present in all
  MUXes>.  You cannot @pemit to the contents of something you don't
  own.
 
  The following switches are available:
    /contents - Send the message to the contents of the named object.
    /object   - Send the message to the named object.
    /list     - Send the message to a list of objects.
 
  You may specify any combination of these switches.

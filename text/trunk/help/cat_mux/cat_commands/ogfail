 
& @ogfail
 
  Syntax: @ogfail <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Ogfail
 
  Sets the message (prefixed by the player's name) that is shown to
  others in the same room when someone tries to give away <object>
  but fails because they didn't pass the object's give lock.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in give failure
  messages, and are evaluated when someone tries to give away the
  object. In function references, 'me' refers to the object being
  given away, while %-substitutions that refer to the enactor (such
  as %n, %#, %p, etc) refer to the (attempted) giver.
 
  Example:
  @ogfail blob = tries to give away a sticky blob of goo.

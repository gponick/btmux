 
& @program
 
  Syntax: @program <player>=<obj/attr>[:<prefix>]
 
  This command allows for small 'programs' within MUX. To understand
  this command, you must first understand the fact that it
  completely bypasses any commands, built-in or otherwise, and
  allows you to send user-input directly into your code.
 
  A simple example:
 
  @vb me=$start:@prog %#=me/vb:Please enter a word:
  @vb me=@emit You entered %0!;@prog %#=me/vc:Please enter another
  word:
  @vc me=@emit This time, you entered %0. You're done!
 
  > start
  Please enter a word:
  > foobar		(Note that @program literally gives you a '>' prompt.)
  You entered foobar!
  Please enter another word:
  > hoopla
  This time you entered hoopla. You're done!
 
{ 'help @program2' for more }

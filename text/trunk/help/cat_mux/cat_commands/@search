 
& @search
 
  Syntax: @search [<player>] [<class>=<restriction>[,<low>[,<high>]]]
 
  Displays information about objects that meet the search criteria.
  Because this command is computationally expensive, it costs 100
  coins.  <player> restricts the search to the named player, while
  <class> and <restriction> control the objects listed.  Type 'help
  search classes' for a list of the classes you may use.
 
  Except when getting lists of players ('@search type=player' or
  '@search flags=P'), you may only search for objects that you own.
  You may limit the range of the search with <low> and <high>, which
  specify the objects to start and stop the search at, respectively.
  The default for <low> is #0 and the default for <high> is the last
  object in the database.
 
  Examples:
    @search flags=PWc              <-- search for connected wizards.
    @search type=room              <-- list all rooms owned by me.
    @search eval=gt(money(##),10)  <-- search for things worth more
                                       than 10.
    @search type=room,100,300      <-- Rooms between #100 and #300,
                                       inclusive
    @search object=Test,5000       <-- Things starting with Test from
                                       object #5000 to the end of the
                                       database.

 
& @cboot
 
  Syntax: @cboot <channel>=<object>
 
  Only wizards, or the owner of the channel can use this command. It
  forcefully removes an object from that channel.
 
  Note: You may specify a player name as <object> if you prefix it
  with an '*'. Otherwise, <object> should be a dbref, or a name of
  an object if you   are nearby it.

 
& @list
 
  Syntax: @list [<option>]
 
  Lists information from internal databases.  Information is available
  about the following options:
    attributes      - Valid object attributes.
    commands        - Commands that you may use (excluding the
                      attribute-setting commands as well as any exits,
                      and $-commands available).
    costs           - Lists the costs associated with many commands
                      and actions.
    default_flags   - Lists the flags that new objects receive by
                      default when created.
    flags           - Lists the name and letter of all the flags.
    functions       - Lists all the available functions.
    options         - Lists several global options and limits.
    powers          - Lists all powers.
    switches        - Lists what commands support switches and the
                      switches that they do support.
  The information provided by the @list command is definitive, as it
  reads the internal tables to produce the information it displays.
 
  Specifying @list with no argument lists the options you may use.

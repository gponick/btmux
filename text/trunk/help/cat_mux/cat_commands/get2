 
& get2
 
  The following switch is recognized:
     /quiet   - Don't perform the @osucc/@asucc or @ofail/@afail
     attributes
                on the target object.  This switch only works if you
                control
                the object.
 
  <object> and <sub-object> may be either players or things.
 
  'take' is the same as 'get'.

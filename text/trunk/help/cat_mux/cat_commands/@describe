 
& @describe
 
  Syntax: @describe <object> = <description>
  Attribute: Desc
 
  Sets the description for <object>, which others see when they look
  at the object.  Giving all your objects, rooms, and exits good
  descriptions is considered to be good building practice.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in descriptions,
  and are evaluated when someone looks at the object.  In function
  references, 'me' refers to the object being looked at, while %-
  substitutions that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#, %p, etc)
  refer to the looker.
 
  Examples:
    <object> @desc vase = You see a delicate Ming vase.
    <exit>   @desc elevator = There is an elevator to the east.

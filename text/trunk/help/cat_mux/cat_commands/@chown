 
& @chown
 
  Syntax: @chown <object>[=<player>]
          @chown <object>/<attr>[=<player>]
 
  The first form changes the ownership of <object> to <player>
  (default is to yourself).  Objects may be things, rooms or exits.
  To chown things, you have to be carrying the thing. For rooms or
  exits, you have to be in the room. Objects must have the CHOWN_OK
  flag set before they may be @chowned. In a room, the command used
  must be @chown here = <name>, and for an object, you must be very
  specific.
 
  The second form changes the ownership of the indicated attribute on
  <object> to <player> (default is the owner of the object).  You
  may only @chown unlocked attributes.  You may @chown unlocked
  attributes on objects that you own to yourself, and you may also
  @chown attributes that you own on objects owned by others to the
  owner of the object.
 
  When an object is @chowned, all unlocked attributes on the object
  are automatically @chowned as well, locked attributes remain owned
  by their original owners.
 
  The HALTED flag is automatically set on the new copy of the object.
  Players can't be @chowned; they always own themselves.

 
& @destroy
 
  Syntax: @destroy[/<switches>] <object>
 
  This command destroys <object> and refunds its cost of creation to
  its owner.  You must own <object> in order to @destroy it, unless
  its DESTROY_OK flag is set, in which case anyone holding it may
  @destroy it.
 
  Rooms, exits, and objects may be destroyed, although the the actual
  destruction of rooms is delayed for up to ten minutes and the GOING
  flag is set on the victim room.  Clearing the GOING flag on the
  room spares it from destruction.
 
  If a thing OR it's owner is set DESTROY_OK, the thing will be
  destroyed with no delay.
 
  The @destroy command will not destroy objects with the SAFE flag set
  unless the /override switch is specified.  The DESTROY_OK flag
  overrides the protection given by the SAFE flag.
 
  The following switches are available:
    /override  - Negate protection offered by the SAFE flag.

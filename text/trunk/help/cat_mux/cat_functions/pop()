 
& pop()
 
  Syntax: pop([<object>], [<position>])
 
  This function returns an item from the caller's stack and removes it
  from the stack. If <position> is specified, it returns the item from
  that position in the stack (items in the stack are numbered with 0
  being the most recently push()ed item) and removes it, otherwise, it
  returns position 0. If <object> is specified and you control it,
  then it returns an item from <object>'s stack.

 
& strmatch()
 
  Syntax: strmatch(<string>,<pattern>)
 
  This function matches <pattern> against the entire <string>,
  returning 1 if it matches and 0 if it does not.  The case of the 
  characters being matched is not significant.
 
  The pattern may contain the wildcards '*' and '?'.  '?' matches any
  one character, while '*' matches any number of characters, 
  including none. So 's?x' would match 'sex' or 'six', but not to 
  'socx', but 's*x' would match any of them.
 
  Examples:
    > say strmatch(This is a test,*Test)
    You say "1"
    > say strmatch(This is a test,*This)
    You say "0"
    > say strmatch(This is a test,*is*is*)
    You say "1"

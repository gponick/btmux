 
& ifelse()
 
  Syntax: ifelse(<expression>,<true string>,<false string>)
 
  This function returns <true string> if <expression> is true (greater
  than 0), <false string> otherwise. Much more efficient than an
  equivalent switch(). It can also return different messages based on
  whether <expression> is nothing or contains text.
 
  Example:
 
  > &TEST me=1
  >&TEST.F me=ifelse(hasattr(me,TEST),Test exists!,Test doesn't
  exist.)
  > say [u(TEST.F)]
  You say "Test exists!"
  > &TEST me=Someval
  > say [u(TEST.F)]
  You say "Test exists!"
  > @wipe me/TEST
  > say [u(TEST.F)]
  You say "Test doesn't exist!"

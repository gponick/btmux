  Syntax: mail(<player name>)
  Syntax: mail(<player>, <mail message #>)
  Syntax: mail()
 
  The first form returns a message corresponding to that mail message
  number in your MUX mailbox. This function can be used to forward
  mail, or as a way to simply transfer mail messages to attributes on
  an object.
 
  The second form returns three numbers, corresponding to the number
  of read, unread, and cleared messages <player> has. The third form
  returns <player>'s <mail message #>. It works like the first form
  except it applies to another player. The last form returns the
  number of messages the evaluating player has. Only wizards can use
  the second and third forms of the function on other players.

& create()
 
  Syntax: create(<object>, <cost>[, <type>])
 
  Works the same as @create <object>, but returns the database number 
  of the object created. <cost> is the cost of making the object. 
  <type> is an optional parameter:
  
  'r' for rooms, 
  't' for things, and 
  'e' for exits. 
  
  If no <type> is specified, then a thing will be created by default. 
  
  This is a side effect function, and should only be used when necessary.
 
  See Also: @create.

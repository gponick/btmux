 
& lte()
 
  Syntax: lte(<integer1>,<integer2>)
 
  Takes two integers, and returns 1 if and only if <integer1> is less
  than or equal to <integer2>, and 0 otherwise.
 
  Warning: Passing anything but integers will produce unexpected
  results, as non-numeric strings are usuallly treated as numeric 0.
 
  Example:
 
  > say lte(4,5)
  You say "1"
  > say lte(5,5)
  You say "1"
  > say lte(6,5)
  You say "0"
  > say lte(foo, bar)
  You say "1"

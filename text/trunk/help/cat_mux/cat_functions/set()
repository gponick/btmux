 
& set()
 
  Syntax: set(<object>, <string>)
 
  Works the same as @set, <object> and <string> are equivalent to what comes
  before and after the '=' sign.  Returns nothing.

  The following demonstrate how to use set() for setting or clearing a flag,
  attribute flag, or attribute on an object. As with @set, flags are cleared
  by using an exclamation mark(!) preceding the flag name for both general and
  attribute flags.  For attributes, an empty value after the colon (:) will
  clear the attribute value from the <object>.

    set(<object>, <flag>)
    set(<object>/<attribute>, <attribute flag>)
    set(<object>, <attribute>:<value>)

  Examples:

  > think [set(me,foo:Twenty Pink Pigs)]
  < think [set(me,foo:)]
  > think [set(me,VERBOSE)]
  > think [set(me/foo,!VISUAL)]

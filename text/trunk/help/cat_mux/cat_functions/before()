 
& before()
 
  Syntax: before(<string1>, <string2>)
 
  Returns the portion of <string1> that occurs before <string2>. If
  <string2> does not occur in <string1>, the entire string is
  returned. If you want to return the portion of the string after the
  first space, use the first() function instead.
 
  Example:
 
  > say before(This is a test,a)
  You say "This is "
  > say before(This is a test,is)
  You say "Th"
  > say before(This is a test, nope)
  You say "This is a test"

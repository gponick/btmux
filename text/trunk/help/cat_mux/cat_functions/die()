 
& die()
 
  Syntax: die(<number of rolls>, <number of sides on die>)
 
  This function simulates rolling dice. It "rolls" a die with the
  specified number of sides, the specified number of times, and sums
  the results.
    
  Example:
  > say die(2, 6)
  You say "8"
 
  The above would roll "2d6" - two six-sided dice, generating a
  result in the range 2-12.

 
& match()
 
  Syntax: match(<string>, <pattern>[, <delim>])
 
  This function matches <pattern> against each word of <string>,
  returning the number of the first word that matches. If no words
  match then 0 is returned. The case of the characters being matched
  is not significant.
 
  The pattern may contain the wildcards '*' and '?'. '?' matches any
  one character, while '*' matches any number of characters, including
  none. So 's?x' would match 'sex' or 'six', but not to 'socx', but
  's*x' would match any of them. <delim> may be used specified to
  specify a delimiter other than a space.
 
  Example:
 
  > say match(This is a test, test)
  You say "4"
  > say match(This is a test, is)
  You say "2"
  > say match(This is a test, *is*)
  You say "1"
  > say match(This is a test, *not*)
  You say "0"
  > say match(This is a test, is a)
  You say "0"

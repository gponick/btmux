 
& grab()
 
  Syntax: grab(<list>, <pattern>[, <delim>])
 
  This function matches <pattern> against each word in <list>,
  returning the first word that matches. If no words match, then an
  empty string is returned. The match is not case-sensitive, and
  wildcard characters are permitted. <delim> may be used to specify a
  list delimiter other than a space.
 
  Example:
 
  > say grab(This is a new test,?e*)
  You say "new"
  > say grab(Holodeck:#10~Airlock:#58~Dorm:#12~Brig:#83,Airlock:*,~)
  You say "Airlock:#58"

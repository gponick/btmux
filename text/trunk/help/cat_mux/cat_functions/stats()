 
& stats()
 
  Syntax: stats([<player>])
 
  This function returns information about the number of objects on the
  MUX, much like the @stats command. If the argument is omitted or is
  'all', then the stats for the entire MUX are returned, otherwise the
  stats for the named player are returned. You can only get stats for
  yourself unless you are a WIZARD.
 
  The stats are returned as a set of 6 numbers, in the same order as
  reported by the @stats command: total objects, rooms, exits, things,
  players, and garbage. This command costs as much as the equivalent
  @stats command (ie: '@stats/all' or '@stats <player>', not the free
  '@stats').
 
  Example:
  > @stats me
  6 objects = 0 rooms, 0 exits, 5 things, 1 players. (0 garbage)
  > say stats(me)
  You say "6 0 0 5 1 0"
  > say stats()
  You say "377 51 165 134 20 7"
  > @stats/all
  377 objects = 51 rooms, 165 exits, 134 things, 20 players. (7
  garbage)

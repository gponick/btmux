 
& subeval()
 
  Syntax: subeval(<string>)
 
  This function's usefulness is primarily useful in conjunction with
  v() as a way to control when evaluation occurs. Escapes are
  evaluated, but {} and functions are not. The location escape is also
  not evaluated.
 
  When used from the command line, it's use is limited to nil because
  evaluation of subeval's parameters occurs before the subeval()
  function is called.

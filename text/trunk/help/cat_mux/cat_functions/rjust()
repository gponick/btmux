 
& rjust()
 
  Syntax: rjust(<string>, <length>[, <fill>])
 
  This function pads a string with leading <fill> characters, or with
  spaces if no fill character is given) ("right-justifies") so it is
  <length> long. If <string> is longer than <length>, the <string> is
  returned; it is not truncated.
 
  Example:
 
  > say -[rjust(foo,6)]-
  You say "-   foo-"
  > say %r0[rjust(foo,6)]7%r01234567
  You say "
  0   foo7
  01234567"
  > say =[rjust(bar,5,.)]=
  You say "=..bar="

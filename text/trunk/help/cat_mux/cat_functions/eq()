 
& eq()
 
  Syntax: eq(<integer1>,<integer2>)
 
  Takes two integers, and returns 1 if they are equal and 0 if they
  are not.
 
  Warning: Passing anything but integers will produce unexpected
  results, as non-numeric strings usually are treated as numeric 0.
 
  Example:
 
  > say eq(1,-1)
  You say "0"
  > say eq(5,5)
  You say "1"
  > say eq(foo, bar)
  You say "1"

 
& index()
 
  Syntax: index(<list>,<character>,<first>,<length>)
 
  This function is similar to extract(), except that an item in the
  list may be more than one word; instead of a space being used to
  separate items in the list, <character> is used. The function
  returns <length> items starting from that in the <first> position.
  Trailing spaces are trimmed. The comma cannot be used as the
  <character> separator.
 
  Example:
 
  > say [index(Cup of Tea | Mug of Beer | Glass of Wine, |, 2, 1)]
  You say, "Mug of Beer"

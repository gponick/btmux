 
& nearby()
 
  Syntax: nearby(<obj1>,<obj2>)
 
  Tests if <obj1> is near <obj2> (if it is in the same location, in
  <obj2>'s inventory, or is <obj2>'s location). You must control
  either <obj1> or <obj2>, or be near either one of them, if both of
  these tests fail then 0 is returned. This function returns 1 if the
  two objects are nearby and 0 if not.

& locate()

  Syntax: locate(<looker>,<string>,<where>)

  The locate function is used to look for an object from the
  perspective of <looker> (You must own <looker>). The database
  number of the item that is found is returned. The <where> parameter
  specifies a list of places to look, from this list:

    * a - Look for absolute references (#<number>)
    * c - Look for exits carried by <looker> (and by <looker>'s
parents).
    * e - Look for exits in <looker>'s location (and the location's
parents).
    * h - Look for 'here', which matches <looker>'s location.
    * i - Look in <looker>'s inventory.
    * m - Look for 'me', which matches <looker>.
    * n - Look for <looker>'s neighbors (other objects in the same
location).
    * p - Look for player names prefixed by a '*'
    * * - Look for everything in the above list.

  You may also specify qualifiers in <where> to help resolve possible
  ambiguities:

    * E - Prefer exits over other types.
    * L - Prefer unlocked exits over locked exits.
    * P - Prefer players over other types.
    * R - Prefer rooms over other types.
    * T - Prefer things over other types.
    * V - Report "Can't find..." and "Which one..." errors to
<looker>.
    * X - Select randomly if search finds multiple matches.

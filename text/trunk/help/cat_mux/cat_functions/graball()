 
& graball()

  FUNCTION: graball(<list>, <pattern>[, <idelim>])

  This function matches <pattern> against each word in <list>, returning
  all the words that match.  If no words match, then an empty string is
  returned.  The match is not case-sensitive, and wildcard characters
  are permitted in <pattern>.  <delim> may be used to specify the <list>
  delimiter other than a space.

  Examples:
    > say graball(This is a test of a test,test)
    You say, "test test"
    > say graball(This is testing a test,tes*)
    You say, "testing test"
    > say graball(It's time|To make|A party!,*party*,|)
    You say, "A party!"

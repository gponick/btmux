 
& regmatch()
 
  Syntax: regmatch(<string>,<regexp>[,<register list>])
 
  This function matches the regular expression <regexp> against the
  entirety of <string>, returning 1 if it matches and 0 if it does
  not.
 
  If <register list> is specified, there is a side-effect: any
  parenthesized substrings within the regular expression will be set
  into the specified local registers, in the order they were specified
  in the list. <register list> can be a list of one through nine
  numbers. If the specified register is -1, the substring is not
  copied into a register.
 
  For example:
  if <string> is 'cookies=30', and <regexp> is '(.+)=([0-9]*)'
  (parsed; note that escaping may be necessary), then the 0th
  substring matched is 'cookies=30', the 1st substring is 'cookies',
  and the 2nd substring is '30'. If <register list> is '0 3 5', then
  %q0 will become "cookies=30", %q3 will become "cookies", and %q5
  will become "30". If <register list> was '0 -1 5', then the
  "cookies" substring would simply be discarded.

 
& hasattrp()
 
  Syntax: hasattrp(<object>, <attribute name>)
 
  Returns 1 if the object or its parent has the named attribute, and 0
  if it does not. If the object does not exist or the player does not
  have the ability to examine the object, #-1 will be returned.
  hasattr() can be used to just check objects for an attribute without
  checking their parent.

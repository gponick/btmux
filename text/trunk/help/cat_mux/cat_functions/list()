 
& list()
 
  Syntax: list(<list>, <eval>[, <delim>])
 
  This function is exactly like iter() but serves a specialized
  purpose: MUX has a buffer limit, and for things like lists of
  players, iter() can quickly become inadequate, since the output is
  cut off before the listing is finished. The normal way to handle
  this is to use a @dolist/@pemit combination, but that takes many
  queue cycles. list() takes <list>, <eval>, and an optional
  delimiter, and evaluates them exactly like iter(). The difference
  is the output: iter() produces a space seperated list, while list()
  outputs each  list item on a new row of the screen.
 
  Note: This is a side effect function. It does not return anything,
  instead, it prints its output directly to the screen of the player
  causing the function to be evaluated. Since it does this, it is not
  hampered by the buffer limit.

 
& ansi2
 
  The percent substitution %c<color code> can be used instead of
  ansi(), and is more efficient.
 
  For example, the equivalent to [ansi(rBf,Color!)] would be:
  %cr%cB%cfColor!%cn
 
  The %cn (to return to normal) is not necessary, but if it is not
  specified the ansi color codes will continue to the end of the
  string.
 
  See also: ANSI.

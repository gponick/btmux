 
& space()
 
  Syntax: space(<count>)
 
  Returns the number of indicated spaces. If <count> is missing,
  negative, or cannot be converted to a number, one space is returned.
  This function is useful when you want to pass a single space (or
  more than one) as a function to an argument, because normally
  leading and trailing spaces are stripped from function arguments.
 
  Example:
  > say space(4)
  You say "    "
  > say edit(Foo bar bletch, space(), X)
  You say "FooXbarXbletch"
 
  Note: Don't use space() when an ljust(), rjust() or center() can
  do the job better. It's ideal to lay things out so if you ever have
  to go in and change wording, you won't have to adjust your space
  functions.

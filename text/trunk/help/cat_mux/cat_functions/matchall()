 
& matchall()
 
  Syntax: matchall(<string>,<pattern>[,<delim>])
 
  This function works identically to the match() function, save that
  it returns all matches, not just the first: It returns the index
  numbers of all words in the list <string> which match <pattern>.
 
  Example:
 
  > say matchall(This is a test of a test,test)
  You say "4 7"
  > say matchall(This is testing a test,tes*)
  You say "3 5"

 
& osuccess
 
  Syntax: @osuccess <object> = <message>]
  Attribute: Osucc
 
  Sets the message (prefixed by the player's name) that is shown to
  others in the room when someone picks up the named player or
  thing, goes through the named exit, or looks at the room and
  passes the room's lock.
 
  Setting Osuccess messages on all takeable objects and usable exits
  is considered good building practice.
 
  Examples:
  <object>
  @osucc vase = carefully picks up the vase.
 
  <exit>
  @osucc doorway = opens the door and leaves the room. The door closes
  behind %o with a click.

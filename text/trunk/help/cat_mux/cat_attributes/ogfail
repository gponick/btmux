 
& ogfail
 
  Syntax: @ogfail <object> = <message>
  Attribute: Gfail
 
  Sets the message (prefixed by the plaayer's name) that is shown to
  others in the same room when someone tries to give <object> but
  fails because he didn't pass the object's give lock.
 
  Function references and %-substitutions are allowed in give failure
  messages, and are evaluated when someone tries to give away the
  object.
 
  In function references, 'me' refers to the object being given away,
  while %-substitutions that refer to the enactor (such as %n, %#,
  %p, etc) refer o the (attempted) giver.
 
  This attribute is only meaningful for players and things, and will
  never be automatically triggered on other object types.
 
  Example:
  @ogfail sword =  can't give away a cursed sword!

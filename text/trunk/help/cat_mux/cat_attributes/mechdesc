 
& mechdesc
 
  Attribute: mechdesc <description>

  This attribute allows the addition of markings on an RS unit, which
  can be seen using the 'view' command from another RS unit.

  Example
  Given that bz is the unitID of an RS unit with 'mechdesc:A nasty
  looking monster of a mech' and bk is the unitID of an RS unit with
  no mechdesc attribute

  >view bz
  A nasty looking monster of a mech
  >view bk
  That target has no markings.

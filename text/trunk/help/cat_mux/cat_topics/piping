& PIPING
  
  Command piping in MUX is similar to piping in a UNIX shell. You string two
  or more commands together using the ;| symbol, much as you would using a
  semicolon. The output from the previous command in a pipe is accessable
  using the %| substitution. This output contains the raw ASCII codes that
  would normally be directly output to your terminal. You may use the
  translate() function to either convert the raw characters in the output to
  MUX substitutions, or strip them out altogether. Like the semicolon, the ;|
  symbol in MUX is taken literally if you type it on the terminal. Currently
  you may only pipe 20 commands in a row.
 
  Examples:
  > &MAILDESC me=$+maildesc *=*:look %0 ;| @mail/quick
                  %1/Description=[translate(%|,1)]

  > &SAYDESC me=$+saydesc *:look %0 ;| say %r%|
  > +saydesc me

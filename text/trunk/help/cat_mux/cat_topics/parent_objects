  Topic: PARENT OBJECTS
 
  Parent objects provide a way for several objects to inherit common
  attributes, exits, and $-commands from a single object, so that
  changing the parent object affects all of its children.  When 
  searching for attributes or exits, first the object itself is 
  checked, then the parent is checked only if the object does not 
  have what was searched for.
 
  Any attribute the parent object has will be passed down to its
  children, if they don't already have one. For instance, if the 
  child object has no description, it will inherit the description 
  of its parent.
 
  Any exits the parent object has will show up in the exit list of the
  child, and may be used as normal exits.
 
  The parent is searched for $-commands as well as the child, and only
  attributes that are unique to the parent are checked, so that
  conflicting attribute names are skipped.  If both have an 
  attribute named "cmd1", only the child's "cmd1" attributes is 
  checked for a $-command.

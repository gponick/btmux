 
& comsys
 
  This is the help for the MUX comsystem. Note that the channel
  names and aliases are case-sensitive. Upon creation, new players
  automatically join the "Public" channel, while guest characters join
  channel "Guests" when they connect.
 
  Note: <alias> is the alias you choose for the channel.
  The "Public" channel for new players is aliased to "pub".
  The "Guests" channel for guests is aliases to "g".
 
  Aliases are the most common way to manipulate channels, and may be
  used in 2 different ways:
        <alias> <who|on|off>
        <alias> <message>
 
  { 'help comsys2' for more}

  setchannelmode: Scan mode:
  Flag: S or s
  
  This mode will listen for any analog signals and attempt to 
  determine  the frequency which those transmissiosn are using. 
  Depending on a number of factors your scanner will determine the 
  frequency either 'somewhat', 'fairly well', 'precisely' or 
  'exactly'.
  
  Example:
  Given that a unit is transmitting in analog mode within radio range 
  and that you have a channel set to scan mode.
  
  You notice a unknown transmission your scanner ....
  Your systems manage to zero on it exactly on channel A.

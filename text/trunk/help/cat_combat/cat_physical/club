  RS Command: club [ID]
  
  This command attempts to attack an RS Unit with your club. Naturally 
  this requires that your 'Mech have a club. A club can be obtained 
  using the grabclub command.
  
  As with all physical attacks you must be within the same hex as the 
  unit you are attacking.
  
  Arguments:
  none - attempt to club your locked target
  * ID - attempt to club the unit specified

& lrs2

   By default the LRS map is centered on your current location. Using
   the <bearing> and <range> permits you to view the map offset from
   your current location by <range> hexes in the direction of
   <bearing>
  
   Example:
   Given that you are located at 100 100
  
   >lrs t
  
   Will display an LRS map of the terrain centered on 100 100
  
   >lrs t 90 20
  
   Will display an LRS map of the terrain centered on 120 100

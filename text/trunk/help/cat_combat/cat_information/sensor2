  Sensors
  -------
  Primary:   Electromagnetic 
          Range:      16-24
          Blocked by: Mountains/Obstacles, 8 pt woods
          Notes:      Easy to hit heavies, good in forests (BTH), 
          overall unreliable (chances of detection/BTH)
  Secondary: Infrared 
          Range:      15
          Blocked by: Fire/Obstacles, 6 pt woods
          Notes:      Easy to hit 'hot' targets, not very efficient in 
          forests (BTH)

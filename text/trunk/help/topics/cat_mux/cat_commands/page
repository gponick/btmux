& page 
 
  Command: page <player-list> [=[<control>]<message>]
 
  This command sends <message> to <player-list>.  If you do not specify a
  name, it defaults to the players you last paged.  You may use either the
  player's name or alias, a list of names and/or aliases, and you may also
  give a string that uniquely matches the start of a player's name on the
  WHO list.
 
  You can format the message one of several ways by specifying ':', ';', or
  '"' as the first character of the message.  ':' and ';' format the message
  as 'From afar, <player> <message>', with ';' omitting the space between
  <player> and <message>.  '"' formats the message in normal page format
  (this is the default).
 
  If your Idle attribute is set to something, then it is sent to anyone
  who successfully pages you.  This is useful for when you are away from
  your terminal for a short while.
 
{ 'help page2' for more }

& page2  
 
  You can selectively disable pages from certain players with the '@lock/page'
  command (players must pass the lock in order to page you).  If someone
  cannot page you, they will be sent a message including of your Reject
  attribute if they try.  If someone pages you while you are not connected,
  they are sent a message including your Away attribute.
  
{ 'help page3' for more. }

& page3
 
  You can also page many players at one time, where all the players you page
  will see the message. 
  Ex:
  > p darkenelf lauren = Hi
  You paged (Darkenelf Lauren) with 'Hi'.
  
  To (Darkenelf Lauren), Dreamline pages: Hi
 
  You only need to type the player-list once, then the next time you page that
  player or set of players, you can abbreviate it with:
  "p :waves."  or,
  "p I'm back."
 
  This will work until you page another player or list of players.

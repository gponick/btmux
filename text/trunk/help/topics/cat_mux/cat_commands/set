& @set
 
  Command: @set[/<switch>] <object>=[!]<flag>
           @set[/<switch>] <object>=<attribute>:<value>
           @set[/<switch>] <object>=<attribute>:_<fromobj>/<fromattr>
           @set[/<switch>] <object>/<attr>=[!]<attrflag>
 
  The first form sets (or clears) the indicated flag on <object>, the
  second form sets the <attribute> attribute on <object> to <value>,
  creating a new user-named attribute if there is no attribute named
  <attribute>.  The third form copies an attribute from another object, and
  the fourth form sets (or clears) an attribute flag on the <attr> attribute
  of <object>.
 
  When setting attributes on an object, you may also use the command
  '@<attribute> <object> = <value>' if the attribute is a predefined
  attribute.  You may also use the command '&<attribute> <object> = <value>'
  to set either predefined attributes or user-named attributes.  Either of
  these is equivalent to the second form of the @set command.

& @set2
 
  The following flags may be set using the fourth form of the @set command:
     no_command - Prevent $-commands and ^-patterns defined in the attribute
                  from being performed.
     no_inherit - Prevents children of the object from obtaining the 
                  attribute.  From their perspective the attribute does not
                  exist.
     visual     - Anyone may see the attribute when they examine you, and
                  may get the attribute with get().
     hidden     - The attribute is only visable to wizards.
     regexp     - When $-commands are matched, treat the pattern as a
                  regular expression rather than a wildcard glob pattern.
     wizard     - The attribute may only be changed by wizards.
 
  The @set command takes the following switch:
     quiet      - Inhibit 'Set.' acknowledgement messages.

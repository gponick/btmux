 >> Help: Speed Demon (Advantages)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 While sprinting, +1 movement to your walk/run speed (3/5 unit --> 4/6)
 Negates slower turn-rates that normally apply to sprinting
 
 Result: You go faster while sprinting than those without this advantage, and
 you turn at normal rates, instead of the slower sprinting rate

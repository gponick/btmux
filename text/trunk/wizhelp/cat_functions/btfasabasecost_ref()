 
& btfasabasecost_ref()
 
  Syntax: btfasabasecost_ref(<UnitRef>)
 
  This function calculates the FASA cost for the reference unit
  <UnitRef> - ie the default templated unit.
 
  Note: The information returned by this function requires the bt-
  advanced-econ compile-time directive.
  
  Note: The base cost is calculated based on a number of factors,
  including the part costs set via btsetpartcost(). Make sure these
  prices are intact before using the FASA cost function.
 
  Error Messages:
 
  * If <UnitRef> is not a valid reference the function returns
    #-1 INVALID REF
  * If the mux was compiled without the bt-advanced-econ directive
    the function returns #-1 NO ECONDB SUPPORT
 
  Example: Given that EXT-4D is a valid refernce
  > think btfasabasecost_ref(ext-4d)

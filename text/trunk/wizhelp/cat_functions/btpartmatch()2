 
& btpartmatch()2
 
  Example:
  > think btpartmatch(IS.LRM-5)
  40
  > think btpartmatch(LRM-5)
  16 40
  > think btpartmatch(LRM*)
  13 37 14 38 15 39 16 40
 
  Notice how the LRM-5 returned two values. This is due to the fact
  that there is a CL (Clan) LRM-5 and an IS (Inner Sphere) LRM-5.
 
  LRM* matched 8 items: The CL and IS versions of LRM-10, LRM-15, LRM-
  20, LRM-5.
 
  Note: Placement position of wildcards is extremely critical. *LRM
  does not equal LRM* or *LRM*

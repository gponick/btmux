 
& btmakepilotroll()
 
  Syntax: btmakepilotroll(<UnitDB>,<roll modifier>,<damage modifer>)
 
  This function causes the pilot of <UnitDB> to make a pilot roll.
 
  The <roll modifier> is added to the applicable pilot-skill base of
  the pilot to provide the base-to-hit of the roll.
 
  If the pilot makes the roll, ie rolls higher than the base-to-hit,
  the event is complete.
 
  If the pilot fails the roll, ie rolls lower than the base-to-hit,
  then the <damage modifier> is added to the pilot-skill base to
  provide the base-to-hit of a roll to determine if the player will
  suffer damage.
 
  If the pilot makes the damage roll, the unit is damaged but not the
  player, and the event is complete.
 
  If the pilot fails the damage roll, both the unit and player suffer
  damage. The player makes a further roll to determine if he/she will
  retain consciousness and the event is complete.
  
  Note: A consciousness roll does not use the modifiers stated in the
  btmakepilotroll function.
 
    * If the pilot passes the initial roll the function returns 1.
    * If the pilot fails the initial roll the function returns 0.

  xcodevalue: status <bv>
  XTYPE: MECH
  
  This xcode value stores status-flags for the RS Unit.
  
  Flags:
  
  * a = For VTOL/Aero units this flag indicates that the unit is 
        landed. It is unused for other unit types.
  * b = Toso is rotated right
  * c = Torso is rotated left
  * d = Unit is started
  * e = Unit is in partial cover. (used internally, mostly. at least 
        one of the people who locked this unit has partial cover on 
        it.)
  * f = Unit is destroyed.
  * g = Unit is jumping.
  * h = Unit is fallen. (skirt/track destroyed for tanks)
  * i = Unit is attempting DFA.
  * j = Unit is performing an action. (set via scode if unit is 
        'doing something'. Prevents turning and speed changes)
  * k = Unit's arms are flipped.
  * l = Unit has AMS and it's activated.
  * m = UNUSED currently.
  * n = pilot is unconcious.
  * o = Unit is being towed.
  * p = Unit has locked a unit ("We mean business")
  * q = Unit has locked a building (<x> <y> b)
  * r = Unit has locked a hex (<x> <y>)
  * s = Unit has locked a hex for ignition (<x> <y> i)
  * t = Unit has locked a hex for clearing (<x> <y> c)
  * u = Unit has MASC enabled.
  * v = Unit is blinded. (la sensors near heat, for instance)
  * w = Unit is COMBAT_SAFE. (can be hit but wont take damage (will, 
        however, be forced to do pilot rolls and such.)
  * x = contacts are reported even if unit is shutdown.
  * y = Unit has just fired.
  * z = Unit has SCHARGE enabled (supercharger).
  * A = Unit has HULLDOWN enabled.
  * B = Units map is under special rules (one of the following:)
    * C = abnormal gravity (not 1G)
    * D = abnormal temperature (enough to adjust heatsinks.) between 
          -30 and +50 degrees celcius is considered normal* 
    * E = Unit is in vacuum.
  * F = UNUSED currently.

 
& @restart
 
  Syntax: @restart
  
  This command literally restarts the game. To the players, it appears 
  as merely a short pause in the action. There are many reasons to 
  @restart, including updating the source code, freeing built-up 
  memory, etc.
  
  @restart dumps and reloads the database, so you cannot use it to 
  change the database. You may recompile and use @restart to 
  implement the changes without having to @shutdown.

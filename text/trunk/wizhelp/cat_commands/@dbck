 
& @dbck
 
  Syntax:  @dbck
  
  This command performs a scan of the database looking for 
  inconsistencies in the object chains, disconnected rooms, rooms 
  waiting to be destroyed, and problems in the object free list.  
  
  Problems that are found are reported to the 
  log file, disconnected rooms are reported to their owners, and 
  players are credited for rooms destroyed.  
  
  Database checks are automatically run periodically, so there is 
  usually no need to use this command.

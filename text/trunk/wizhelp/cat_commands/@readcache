 
& @readcache
 
  Syntax: @readcache
  
  This command reads the commonly-used text files and help indexes on 
  the game directory into an internal cache, destroying the prior 
  contents of the cache.
  
  Use this command whenever you change one of the text of index files 
  in the game directory. 
  
  NOTE - Be sure and run mkindx to produce new index files before 
  running @readcache.

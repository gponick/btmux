 
& loadnew
 
  Mechrep Command: loadnew <templatename>
  
  This command loads the specified template onto the MECH object.
  
  Example:
  Given that #1234 is a valid MECH object:
  
  >settarget #1234
  >loadnew EXT-4D
  Template loaded.
  
  which is the equivalent of:
  
  think btloadmech(#1234, EXT-4D)

  NOTE - when specifying the amount of armor, you should specify the 
  total amount for that location, not the amount required to bring the 
  armor up to that total. Therefore if a unit normall has 20 points of 
  armor at that location, and currently has 10 - you specify a <val> 
  of 20.
  
  Example:
  Given that #1234 is an EXT-4D which requiress repair to the front 
  armor on the LL and replacement of a MediumLaser in the RA at 
  critslot 4:
  
  >settarget #1234
  Mech to repair changed to #1234
  
  >repair LL A 19
  Armor repaired!
  
  >repair RA C 4
  Critical location repaired!

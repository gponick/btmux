  @list_file <file>

  Lists the contents of one of the message files that are shown during 
  the connect/create/disconnect process as conditions warrant.  The 
  following files may be listed:
  
     badsite_connect - shown when a connection is opened from a 
                       forbidden site.
     connect          - shown when a connection is opened from a site 
                        for which registration is not enforced.
     create_register  - shown when the 'create' command is used from a 
                        site for which registration is enforced.
     down             - shown when a non-wizard attempts to connect to 
                        or create a character when logins are 
                        disabled.
     full             - shown when a non-wizard attempts to connect to 
                        or create a character when the maximum 
                        number of connected players are connected.  
                        Note that this is different from what happens 
                        when someone tries to  connect but there are 
                        no free descriptors, which is machine-
                        dependent (usually the connect attempt hangs 
                        or is rejected).

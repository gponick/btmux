& btech_moddamagewithwoods

  Config parameter: btech_moddamagewithrange <0/1>
  Default: 0

  Enables a modifier which varies damage to a unit if it occupies
  a hex with light or heavy woods.

  When enabled damage is reduced by -2 for light woods and
  by -4 for heavy woods.

  Note: The modifier does not affect the BTH for the shot. Nor does
  the terrain type of any intervening hexes (ie hexes the shot must
  pass through to reach the target).

& clone_copies_cost

  Config parameter: clone_copies_cost <yes/no>
  Default: NO

  Indicates whether or not @cloned objects inherit the cost of the
  original.

  If disabled, @cloned objects cost the same as a @create that doesn't
  specify the object cost.  The new owner is charged the correct
  amount in either case.

  See also: @clone.

& bad_name

  Config parameter: bad_name <wildcarded-name>

  Specifies that any name that matches <wildcarded-name> may not be
  used as a player name.  Attempts to create a player with a
  disallowed name (or to rename to a disallowed name) will be
  rejected.  Normally, words that lead off messages from MUX are
  disallowed, some sites may wish to disallow some obscene names as
  well.

& command_quota_max

  Config parameter: command_quota_max <amount>
  Default: 100

  Specifies the maximum value for the command quota for connected
  users.

  A user's command quota is only increased if it is below this value.
  Each command a user types in (commands executed by machines do not
  count) decreases the quota by 1, and the user's commands are only
  executed if the quota is greater than zero.

& quotas

  Config parameter: quotas <yes/no>
  Default: no

  Indicates whether or not building quotas are enforced and
  maintained.

  Quotas are stored as a relative number, ie. number of objects that
  the player may create, not the total number that the player may
  create.

  If quotas are turned off and turned back on later, any building or
  @destroying that occurs in the interim does not affect the quotas.

  See also: @allquota, @create, @destroy, @dig, @open, @quota, QUOTAS.

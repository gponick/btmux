& attr_cmd_access

  Config parameter: attr_cmd_access [!]<privilege> [[!]<privilege>]...

  Changes the access rights on all attribute-setting commands in
  parallel.

  Use this parameter to allow or deny access to the attribute-setting
  commands as a group.  This directive should normally be followed
  by access directives to properly set access to restricted
  attributes.

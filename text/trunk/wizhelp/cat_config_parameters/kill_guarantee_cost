& kill_guarantee_cost

  Config parameter: kill_guarantee_cost <amount>
  Default: 100

  Specifies the amount of money you have to spend (ie. kill target =
  <amount>) to have a 100% chance of killing them (assuming there
  are no other factors, such as the victim being immortal or in a
  HAVEN room, etc).  The chance of a successful kill is <amount
  spent> / <kill_guarantee_cost>.

& function_recursion_limit

  Config parameter: function_recursion_limit <num>
  Default: 50

  This directive sets the maximum number of nested function calls that
  may be made before the function call is aborted and the string
  '#-1 FUNCTION RECURSION LIMIT EXCEEDED' is returned.  Normally this
  is not a problem, but the u() function can be used to cause
  infinite recursion (unless blocked by a recursion limit)

& match_own_commands

  Config parameter: match_own_commands <yes/no>
  Default: NO

  Specifies whether or not objects search themselves for $-commands
  when a command does not match an exit or an internal command.  In
  order for players to search themselves for commands, both
  match_own_commands and player_match_own_commands must be set to
  yes.

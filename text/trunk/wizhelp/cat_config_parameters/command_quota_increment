& command_quota_increment

  Config parameter: command_quota_increment <amount>
  Default: 5

  Specifies the number of commands by which the command quota for
  connected users each timeslice.  Each command a user types in
  (commands executed by machines do not count) decreases the quota
  by 1, and the user's commands are only executed if the quota is
  greater than zero.

  See also: command_quota_max, timeslice.

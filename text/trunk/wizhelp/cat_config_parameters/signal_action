& signal_action

  Config parameter: signal_action <default|exit>
  Default: default

  Specifies what action to take when a fatal signal is received.  The
  possibilities are:

     default  - Log the error, produce a panic dump, dump a core file,
                and restart the game using the last reliably saved
                database. For a description of the restart process,
                see @restart.
     exit     - Log the error, and exit, hopefully with a core file.

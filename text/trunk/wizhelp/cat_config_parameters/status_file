& status_file

  Config parameter: status_file <filename>
  Default: shutdown.status

  If you give an argument to the @shutdown command, that argument is
  written out to the file named by this directive.  The file can be
  used by an auto-restart script to decide whether or not to bring
  the MUX back up, for instance.

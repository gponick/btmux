& forbid_site

  Config parameter: forbid_site <addr> <mask>

  Indicates that connections are to be rejected from sites whose
  address  matches the specified address when ANDed with the mask.
  The contents of the file specified by badsite_file is sent
  immediately before closing the connection.  This directive may be
  used to restrict access to just the local network, or to prevent
  access from troublemaking sites.

  The default is for all sites to be allowed to connect, none
  forbidden.

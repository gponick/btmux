& timeslice

  Config parameter: timeslice <amount>
  Default: 100

  Specifies the interval at which connected users' command quotas are
  increased.  Each command a user types in (commands executed by
  machines do not count) decreases that user's quota by 1, and the
  user's commands are only executed if the quota is greater than
  zero.

  See also: command_quota_incr, command_quota_max.

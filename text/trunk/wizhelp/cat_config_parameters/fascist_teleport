& fascist_teleport

  Config parameter: fascist_teleport <yes/no>
  Default: no

  If this parameter is set to yes, then players (and objects) may not
  teleport out of locations that they do not control or which are not
  set JUMP_OK.  If the teleporting player is inside an object, the
  room that ultimately contains the object is checked.  Going home
  is unaffected.

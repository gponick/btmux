& default_home

  Config parameter: default_home <location>
  Default (player_starting_home)

  Sets the home location for objects which have an invalid home
  (whether because the home location was deleted, or is owned by
  another player and is not set ABODE) and the home of their owner
  is also invalid.  If this parameter is not set, the value of
  player_starting_home is used instead.

& dark_sleepers

  Config parameter: dark_sleepers <yes/no>
  Default: yes

  Indicates whether or not disconnected players are to be considered
  'dark', so that they do not show up when a player looks in the
  room that they are in.  Disconnected players can still be found by
  examining the room or by using [next()] to follow the contents
  chain for the room.

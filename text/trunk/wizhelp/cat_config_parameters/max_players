& max_players

  Config parameter: max_players <num>
  Default: -1 (unlimited)

  Sets the maximum number of players that may be connected at any one
  time.

  Note that wizards are allowed to login even if they would
  exceed the limit, and that this limit does not override any limits
  imposed by the system running the MUX (such as the maximum number
  of net connections a process may have).

  Players connecting when there are max_players players connected
  receive the contents of the file named by the full_file directive,
  and the full_motd_message (also settable via @motd/full), and are
  disconnected.

  See also: @motd, full_file, full_motd_message.
